### Pilot 2
* Ning Leng and Eric Nantz reported that Pilot 2 was submitted on 2022-11-18, upholding the working groups tradition of submitting right before Thanksgiving, and that confirmation was received from the the FDA.
* Paul Schuette explained that since Pilot 2 was  not a production submission it was necessary to make a manual request to receive it. Consequently, his group did not receive it until earlier this wee.
* Heysoo Cho said that she will begin working on the submission next week.
* Eric Nantz offered to be available to help if the FDA had any questions.

### Pilot 3
Joel Laxamana briefly reviewed the preparations his team is making for Pilot 3 and said that the proposal is ready for transmission to the FDA. Paul suggested that the proposal should be sent to everyone in the working group and not just the FDA. Joel agreed to put the proposal in the Submissions WG GitHub repository and send the link to everyone in the working group.

Joel noted that many of the Pilot 3 concepts were taken from the ADRG for Pilot 2 and mentioned that they are checking against the CDISC versions as they build the package.

### Pilot 4
Eric said that he hopes to ramp up Pilot 4 work after the Pilot 2 submission. The simplest plan will be just to containerize the Pilot 2 submission. [Podman](https://podman.io/) is the initial choice for a the container technology.

The group also expressed about aligning the Pilot 4 project with the Validation Hub to stand up a repo of validated packages. This would open up the possibility of hosting the container on the validation repo. The Validation Hub repo for this project is: https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg
