title: "Introduction"
description: |
  Welcome to the **R Consortium "R Submissions"** Working Group which will be focused on IT and platform challenges that must be addressed in order to make "all R" regulatory submissions.
  
  The mission of the group partially overlaps with work underway in the R Validation Hub and RTRS working groups, and eventually these groups may see some consolidation. However, for now, we have the opportunity to set the agenda for this new area.
