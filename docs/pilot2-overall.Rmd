**Key evaluation aspects**:

- For Submitter
  - Submission of proprietary R packages requires advanced computation
  - Submit analysis codes as R package
- For FDA Reviewer
  - Reproduce analysis results by reconstructing submitted proprietary packages / retrieving open source packages and rerunning the analysis package
