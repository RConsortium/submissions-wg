We received written feedback from the FDA which is available in the submissions repository here. There were a few findings with the pilot:\n\nA mislableed treatment arm (This is a potential bug)\nA rounding issue\nTable fomatting\n\nNL noted that our execution team was not able to recreate the rounding issue, and asked PS is it would be possible to for us to look at the FDA code. This is possible, but needs to be cleared with management and may take a couple of weeks,\nNing and the other members of the submission execution team are looking into these and hope to be able to submit a follow up to Pilot 1 in several weeks. Ning asked if the FDA would be willing to review the resubmission of Pilot 1. PS said that this would be fine.\nThe discussion then moved to the contents of Pilot 2. PS noted that with submitting .R files we already met some of the goals we had been planning for Pilot 2.\nTo begin the discussion JR asked: what kinds of things have been considered difficult to do in submissions in the past and what could we do that would be impressive from the FDA’s point of view?\nPS suggested package versioning and archival issues\nNL suggested four topics that have come up in previous discussions.\n\nPackage versioning\nUsing Docker\nAlternative data formats to sas7bdat\nShiny\n\nEN agreed that these were the top issues, and noted that using a container such as Docker would also solve the package versioning.\nPS remarked that doing anything with data formatting is unlikely at this time. Two recent pilots failed to come up with an alternative. This is “not the hill to die on” right now. It is probably an issue that is worthy of broader discussion with other groups such as ASA, DIA, or PHUSE. PS suggested looping in Heather Crandall and OBI, the Office of Business Informatics.\nPS also noted that Docker has made changes to licensing so that FDA is not able to play with local installations of Docker. EN said that he was aware of these issues and suggested alternatives such as podman which he believes to be the first candidate to investigate. PS stated that any container technology would have to be approved by IT. He also noted that the FDA is currently using an obsolete version of Docker, and that upgrading to a newer version would have to go through the FDA approval process. Also, the FDA security team will not let containers have access to the hard drive. The group concurred that since getting Docker approved would not be any easier than podman the group should explore this new technology. EN offered to take the lead on this and enter the task into the Kanban board.\nPS suggested that since we have just shown that we can get a package through the gateway, the next step might be to turn a shiny app into a package and pass it through the gateway. EN confirmed that this is indeed possible and noted that the golem package can do this and deploy the shiny app locally without having to go to a server.\nYZ noted that he has seen several linkedin posts about using Shiny for submissions and asked if that was happening in this group. PB stated that this Shiny submissions effort is being run by the R/Pharma group. They are planning to start holding monthly meeting, the first being at the end of January. R/Pharma wants to focus on the technical issues.\nThe group agreed that the path forward with Shiny as a package is much more straightforward than using containers, and suggested that we settle on Shiny for Pilot 2 and Containers for Pilot 3.\nThe discussion then turned on which Shiny app we should select. TD suggested the teal package that Roche is working on and noted that Roche is planning to make this open source. The group agreed that the source code of any Shiny package submitted should be open source.\nAt 30:03 into the video, TL demonstrated the teal package. After the demo, the group discussed the benefits of submitting a complicated package like teal which has several interesting features versus a simple app that meets the basic requirements. PS noted that ideally we would want to launch server from a local PC and not touch a server. To do otherwise would require the FDA to involve a special contractor and funding. The group decided to use a simple app and NL suggested wrapping the Pilot 1 modules into a Shiny app.\nAt 46:15 into the video, TL demonstrates calling different packages from a Shiny app.\nEN agreed to open up a second repo for development of Pilot 2. We will keep use the same setup as Pilot 1 and have the kanban board on the main submissions repo point to the Pilot 2 repo.\nJR said that he would follow up with PHUSE about work they may be doing on the formatting issue.\nNL asked about accumulus synergy, an FDA and cross industry looking at cloud solutions. Would there be a way to connect our container effort with accumulus? The group suggested searching for a contact.\nJR noted that before the next submission of Pilot 1 we must write to the FDA to reopen the gateway.\nThe next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM Pacific Time Friday, February 4, 2022."

Furthermore, the group would like to have the R Consortium act as the sponsor of the pilot submission, and is looking for guidance to determine if this is possible.\n6:31 Ethan Chen expressed a desire to support the R Consortium initiative and mentioned that R is currently included as a supported file eCTD file format. See Specifications for File format Types Using eCTD Specifications.\n15:00 1. Test the exchange mechanism through the gateway and routing to the specific in the review division 2. Once received, can they be open and reviewed\nEthan stated that his team is involved mainly with the exchange method.\n15:30 In general, to initiate an a submission in a production environment an organization must open an ESG Accoount. This process includes requesting an account and writing a Non-Repudiation letter to the FDA. (See the AS2 Account Checklist). The FDA then will assign an application number.\n19:32 Doug Kelkhoff asks if it is possible for a non-profit such as the R Consortium could be a sponsor. Jiang Xu believes it is possible but will require further discussion.\n22:40 Adrian Waddell describes the interplay of the exchange and review processes.\n23:00 Ethan Chen outlines two major concerns:\n\nSecurity (Executable files not accepted)\nTo meet the error records management requirement the FDA must be able to open any submitted file for the entire retention period which could be up to 30 years.\n\n26:00 Joe ask Ethan if there is someone in particular who could help setting up the ESG account. Ethan replies that Heather and Jiang could help and also help to determine if the R Consortium could be a sponsor.\n26:55 Heather Crandall recommends becoming familiar with the requirements on the ESG Webpage.\n28:00 Doug Kelkhoff initiates a discussion of the challenges that the working group is hoping to address.\nThe ask right now is for the working group to understand what steps we must undertake and who would be our FDA contact is we get stuck.\n30:15 Jiang Xu states that the FDA would want to know exactly what things we think the FDA would need to test and notes that different FDA offices and centers would need to be involved.\n34:00 Yilong Zhang points out that a goal of the working group is to test how internally R packages could be transmitted to the FDA as part of a submission.\n35:25 Doug Kelkhoff describes challenges including file extensions and case sensitivity\n36:55 Adrian Weddell notes that if the working group is able to successfully make a pilot submission and put it out in the open it would provide a guide for other companies to follow. He also raised the issue of probing the security issues around the way R packages often require dependent packages to be installed.\n40:10 Bell Feng compares an R script to a SAS macro and asks for clarification about how we are using packages. Doug Kelkhoff clarifies that the issue is about the using R best practices and being able to install packages required to perform and analysis and not just submit R scripts.\n50:00 Joe asks if there are any other FDA offices or groups that the working group should contact. Jiang and Heather do not think any other contacts are necessary to contact at this time. Jiang indicates that they will discuss this within the FDA.\nThe group agreed to meet next on Wednesday June 30, 2021.\nThe video of the meeting is available here Passcode: V@.?eq85\nAction Items for the Working Group\n\nGenerate a list of potential issues and items that we think the FDA will want to evaluate.\nBecome familiar with process and requirements for opening an ESG account as described on the Electronic Submissions Gateway site."

Consequently, his group did not receive it until earlier this wee.\nHeysoo Cho said that she will begin working on the submission next week.\nEric Nantz offered to be available to help if the FDA had any questions.\n\n\n\nPilot 3\nJoel Laxamana briefly reviewed the preparations his team is making for Pilot 3 and said that the proposal is ready for transmission to the FDA. Paul suggested that the proposal should be sent to everyone in the working group and not just the FDA. Joel agreed to put the proposal in the Submissions WG GitHub repository and send the link to everyone in the working group.\nJoel noted that many of the Pilot 3 concepts were taken from the ADRG for Pilot 2 and mentioned that they are checking against the CDISC versions as they build the package.\n\n\nPilot 4\nEric said that he hopes to ramp up Pilot 4 work after the Pilot 2 submission. The simplest plan will be just to containerize the Pilot 2 submission. Podman is the initial choice for a the container technology.\nThe group also expressed about aligning the Pilot 4 project with the Validation Hub to stand up a repo of validated packages. This would open up the possibility of hosting the container on the validation repo. The Validation Hub repo for this project is: https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg\n\n\nOther Business\nJBR asked Ning and Joel for summary paragraphs for Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 for inclusion in end of the year reports on working group status. Ning is working on a blog post about Pilot 2 for inclusion in the R Consortium Blog.\nThere were no updates available about efforts to make pilot submissions to other regulatory agencies.\nThe following events were identified as possibilities for delivering presentations:\n\nThe Appsilon Shiny conference: ShinyConf 2023 March 15-17 - Ning and Eric are drafting an abstract\nR/Medicine June 8-9\nR/Pharma\nuseR! 2023\nPosit::conf\nASA BioPharma SWE Workshop in September\n\n\nOther future plans:\n\nNing noted that she and Yilong have been thinking about a journal submission and have begun writing a draft.\nThe group also agreed that they would like to do another R - Adoption Webinar.\nFinally, Eric noted that he would like to rework the Submissions repository site and build it on a Quarto framework.\nThe next meeting of the Submissions WG will be at 10AM PST, Friday 13, 2023. This is a one week delay to move the meeting beyond the holiday season."

Ning Leng replied that the European Medicines Agency announced a new pilot project where they will run a number of pilot studies over the next couple of years in which they will accept data and code. Ning said that her team discussed this with Chris Price of whose who said that the EMA would want to review real data. This appears to preclude the R Consortium from participating from this effort. However, the group agreed we would be happy to help a sponsor company submit an R pilot.\nAction Item if there is sponsor company interested in submitting R code as part of an EMA pilot project, the RC Submissions WG would be happy to help an participate in a shared learning.\n\n\nPilot 2\nNing Leng and Eric Nantz gave an update on the Pilot 2 project Eric is testing the Pilot 2 submission on Windows virtual machines using two version of R v4.1.2 and 4.2.0.\nPaul Schuette confirmed that the FDA team would prefer to keep the Pilot 2 deployment on a local machine and Eric said that the documentation is being written from that point of view.\nEric needs the RC credit card to proceed with the shinyapps.io deployment.\nAction Items\n\nEric would like help testing the Pilot 2 Windows deployment. WG members please help with the testing process.\nJBR will speak with Elisa Trevino to generate the credit card for the shinyapps.io setup.\n\n** Ning will email the WG when the submission documents are ready for review. WG members please help with this review.\nTarget Date for Pilot 2 Ning and Eric agreed that Monday, September 26, 2022 is the target date for the Pilot 2 submission.\n\n\nJapanese and Chinese Authorities\nNing believes that the companies are interested in proceeding with pilot R submissions but the authorities are reticent because they do not have the resources to review pilots.\nJBR commented that it appears that our pilot approach is not appropriate for China and Japan and ask the group to think about alternatives for approaching these authorities.\nPilot 3 Eric said that he recently spoke Martin Wimpress and authority in this area who strongly recommends podman which is considered an open source, binary equivalent to docker.\nThe group agreed that we should build a podman team that comprises representatives from at least two or three different companies as well as a representative from the FDA. Paul Schuette volunteered that he would ask his FDA management to assign someone to the team. T\nAction Item WG members please look within your companies to recruit people with the podman expertise for the Pilot 3 team. Paul noted that another FDA center has approval for podman and the it would take him a couple of months to obtain similar approval for his center. the WG would like to launch the container team at the October meeting.\n\n\nPilot 1 - adam\nNing introduced Thomas Neitmann and Joel Laxamana who are creating a proposal to construct a submission that would use the R to generate ADaM data from the cdisc data used in Pilots 1 and 2. The project would make use of the admiral R package.\nAction Item JBR will ask the RC to create two repositories under the R Consortium organization on GitHub: submissions-pilot1-adam-extension and submissions-pilot1-adam-extension-to-fda . Ideally the former would be a fork of the submissions-pilot1 repo and the latter a fork of the submissions-pilot1-to-fda repo.\n\n\nDescribe the Sturcture of Subgroups\nThere was a request to describe the Submission WG subgroups sufficiently for newcomers to find their way around. The main website for the subgroups is https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg\nJBR asked the subgroup leaders to list all of the individuals who participated in the various subgroups, even those who may now be inactive.\nThe group agreed that it would be appropriate to keep a record of everyone who helped with the working group in order to recognize their contributions. We\nAction Item Subgroup leaders should list participants, and write a couple of sentences about how newcomers can get involved.\nThe next meeting of the submissions working group will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, October 7, 2022."

The current solution is to have people accessing the gateway on behalf of the RC use an R Consortium email address. JR wants to make sure that this is fine with the FDA.\nAt 6:37 into the video PS begins providing FDA feedback on the submission.\nThe initial findings were:\n\nThe submission was partially successful\nThe were no problems with the .R extensions\nThe FDA was unable to find the Pilot1wrappers package. However, the * * FDA analyst was able to generate tables\nThe FDA thinks there may have been a switch in the high bit vs. bit settings and asked the WG to check this.\nThe FDA analyst was able to retrieve the pilot1wrappers package from the Submission WG website, download the code and verify the results\nThe FDA noted that including a dependency chart showing the 2nd and 3rd order dependencies would be very helpful. If this were and actual submission, at least one IR request would have been generated.\n\nOn behalf of the WG, JR thanked the FDA team for making extra effort to retrieve the wrapper package and run the code.\nIn the subsequent discussion it was determined that the FDA analysts overlooked the instructions, buried in the ADRG, to unpack the pilot1wrappers from the file r0plg.txt. Once this was clarified HC, the FDA analyst, was able to execute the command and unpack the pilot1wrappers package. HY noted that in her experience, submissions with R code tend to be ad hoc, and that it is common to include a README file. The WG took note and agreed that it would be a good idea to include a README file that highlights the key steps, maybe by referring to the ADRG.\nNext, followed a discussion about the requested dependency chart tree diagram. PS noted that the importance of dependencies depends on the setting. When running from a standard machine, FDA analysts are able to pull packages from the internet. However, when running from one of their scientific enclaves high performance computing environments they must port in the packages. To illustrate the problem with dependencies HC showed the error messages generated by calling R packages previously installed on her machine, but which did not have the dependencies installed that are required to run the submission code.\nThe problem seems to be that every file in the submission needs the library calls. This problem needs to be addressed.\nHC also identified a problem of not having write permissions.\nThe temporary solution seems to be to copy the file into a temporary folder. This problem needs more thought.\nIt was agreed that the WG should produce a document about establishing the proper environment. AW suggests that there are two possible actions: 1. Copying to a local folder might clear up most of the problems 2. If not, the WG should look into environment reproducibility\nPS noted that the FDA does not need to run on a central server. This implies that we can assume FDA analysts running on their local environments for the near future.\nPS suggested having a pre-submission meeting explaining everything that is necessary to get everything installed and working.\nAW suggested that we set up the submission assuming that each file will be run from a fresh R session, and that perhaps we could run some tests to see if the environment is as is expected.\nNL asked about writing a blog post about the pilot submission. The WG agreed to write up the post and have PS and HC review.\nYL asked about redoing the submission. PS said indicated that is common practice.\nNL said that she and HC would like to schedule a separate meeting early next year to discuss where the various participating companies are in the process of making R submissions. Please let NL know if you are interested in participating.\nThe next meeting is set for 9:00 AM Pacific Time on Friday, January 7, 2022."

JBR stated that it is great benefit to the R Community and to the R Consortium that all interested folks can join working groups. There is no requirement that working members be employed by companies who are members of the R Consortium. He noted that, so far, having large numbers of people attend the monthly meeting of the submission working group meeting has not been a problem.\nJBR also noted that small teams of WG members have been meeting separately from the general meeting to accomplish the technical work and asked that all of these please make an effort to take minutes and upload them to the appropriate repository. These meetings can be very brief limited to who attended and some bullet points of what was accomplished.\nJBR then ask NL to give a brief overview of WG activity. NL stated that in addition to the Pilot 1 team, there are two groups working on projects.\n\nThe Pilot 2 submission that is developing a shiny app based on the analyses developed in the Pilot 1 submission. This app will then be made into an R package, wrapped up with the analysis and data used in Pilot 1 and then submitted through the FDA gateway. The team working on this meets every two weeks and has already developed a preliminary version of the shiny app. They will ask the extended working group to review the draft shiny app. if all goes well they think they should be able to make the Pilot 2 submission in two to three months.\nAnother subgroup has just been formed to make a Pilot 1 submission the PMDA, the Japanese health authority. This will essentially be the Pilot 1 submission to the FDA with some translate materials. SH and HW are are members of this team. TL asked to be included.\n\nAt 16:16 minutes into the video TL demonstrated the preliminary of the Pilot 2 Shiny App. He described how filtering and subsetting works.\n\nJBR suggested that eventually the shiny app should be deployed to an R Consortium property.\nThe group they began a discussion about how the Shiny App would fit into a typical FDA workflow. PS that his group has not yet dealt with any Shiny apps and they are only in the preliminary stages of developing their own apps. He also remarked that there would still be a significant amount of preliminary work to set up for an analysis.\nPS said that an issue with Shiny will be reproducibility. He remarked that he is following the work of Joe Cheng and Carson Sievert on the Shiny Meta project which will generate code that captures the Shiny app settings to allow users to independently rerun an analysis.\nPS remarked that the ability to do subgroup analysis would be a value add to the reviewers. The Shiny app would be an auxiliary tool. The main task would still be to do an independent analysis of the models and show that the models are appropriately developed and executed.\nRJ then asked PS whether the FDA has the infrastructure to receive a Shiny app and deploy it throughout the enterprise. PS replied that do not yet have the capabilities for enterprise deployment, but that two different possible solutions are being discussed: one of these is OCS the Office of Computational Science.\nRight now, the FDA is running things locally. The best that the FDA can do is to install a shiny app and submission package on a number of workstations which would provide remote access to FDA analysts. The workstations would not be networked. At the present time, the FDA does not permit analysts to use servers.\nJBR asked PS: “Given the FDA environment as it is now, not as we all would like it to be, is there anything the we can do do facilitate your workflows?”\nPS replied that the FDA is in the process of updating its workflows including the use of GitLab, but that he does not know how they could make things easier without achieving the enterprise environment being discussed. JBR remarked that if any of the FDA\nJBR if anyone in the meeting was working on the containers project. EM stated that he would like to be involved. NL noted that Eric Nantz has already begun collecting documentation. JBR pointed out that researching the use of containers for R submissions would be a project that newcomers to the Submissions WG could help with.\nIn summary, the WG has two active project and two that are just beginning: 1. The Shiny app for the Pilot 2 submission 2. Research on containers for Pilot 3 3. A Pilot 1 submission for Japan 4. A pilot 1 submission for China\nThe next meeting of the WG will be on Friday May 6, 2022 at 9AM Pacific Time."

NL noted that the content of the resubmission included:\n\nFixing the table heading bug\nAddressing the rounding error that was due to using 1.96 in the calculation of a confidence as opposed to using the exact value\nImplementing some best practices that had been suggested by the FDA\n\nNL also stated that although we heard back informally from the FDA, we have not yet received a formal reply. PS confirmed that the FDA reviewer was able to open the submission and access the contents. PS stated that he would check with his supervisor to provide an update, and noted that the fact that we are still going through the test process and not through an actual submission, might account for the slow response.\nJR asked BS if there was any channel we should use to communicate with the FDA when we had questions. BS suggested that sending an email to edata@fda.hhs.gov might be helpful.\nNL then provided an update for Pilot which involves sending a shiny app through the gateway, but using the same data set and same analyses as used in Pilot 1.\n\nHY has begun programming the shiny app\nEN and EM are working on improving the formatting of tables in the shiny app\nThe app will be published to a shiny.io server in order to get feedback from the WG\nEN is leading the effort to write the ADRG reviewers guide. A conversation has started in the issue tracker.\nWork is going well NL and EN believe that will have something to show in a month or so.\n\nThere was a short discussion on how much documentation the shiny app needs. EN and others stressed that the goal of this pilot is to prove the concept of passing the app through the gateway what is being planned will be more than sufficient.\nJR asked if we have he bandwidth to begin thinking about Pilot 3. He stated that people who are discovering the WG are asking how they can get involved, and asked if there were certain task we could point them to and also are there any particular skill sets we need?\nThe WG thought that we do have the bandwidth to assimilate new members and run parallel tasks.\nHY offered that she is in contact with colleagues who are working with the Japanese PMDA, and she should be able to have some information to share in Q2. She noted that the Japanese are beginning to accept R submissions.\nThe WG agreed that we should initiate new projects for Pilot 1 submissions for both Japan and China. We should stand up new repos for each of these projects and begin to sub teams to work on them in parallel with the other WG projects.\nJR asked if the technical approach we have taken with Pilot 1 for the FDA would work for Pilot 1 Japan. NL noted that we would Japanese and Chinese translation for all documents submitted to Japan and China respectively. However, the strategy of wrapping the R code into text for transmission, passing it through the gateway, and then unpacking it is appropriate.\nJR asked we need help researching container technology for Pilot 3. EN replied that he has already begun this research and his goal is to identify multiple orchestrators of container technology. He would like to have at least two potential solutions. Singularity and Rocker ar both possibilities.\nEN agreed to put an issue into the main repo and stand up a Pilot 3 repo for the project details. JR noted that getting the folks behind the Rocker project would open up even more connections and opportunities to get help.\nJR pointed out the as we progress further through the different projects we will need help writing blog posts and communicating what we have done. He then asked if anyone was planning to send a talk to rstudio::conf which will happen in July or useR! 2022. NL offered that she has submitted to SDSS and would be happy to submit something similar to rstudio::conf. NL will start and issue to discuss upcoming projects.\nEN offered to put a contact list on the website to organize people wishing to help.\nNL noted that many of the WG members are also participating in Shiny for Submissions Task Force and suggested we have a standing agenda to coordinate the two groups.\nThe WG will next meet at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, April 1, 2022."

The team recently set up Pilot 2 on the golem framework. teal has been fully incorporated, and the team is in the finals stages of completing the documentation preparing the submission. NL estimates that a submission in mid August is possible.\nAction Item: JR will connect with James Black to determine how Roche wants to announce the open sourcing of teal.\nJR asked for updates from the efforts to make pilot submissions to the authorities in Japan and China. Based on conversations with her Roche colleagues, NL reported that there have be no new developments. The Japanese agency doubts that they have the resources to evaluate a pilot submission. The Chinese authority still appears to be interested in an industry collaboration. Roche China is attempting to form a working group, Ning offered to put anyone interested in touch with here Chinese colleague leading this effort.\nJR asked: under the assumption that Pilot 2 goes really well, does the WG have any concrete suggestions for advancing the use of Shiny in submissions. EN noted that just getting Shiny in the process is a big step.\nThere was some discussion about the target audience for the Pilot 2 submission, and how the Shiny app might appeal to a larger FDA audience than the statisticians who would review a submission.\nThere was a questions about whether FDA reviewers would want to reproduce the Shiny app interactivity. PS noted that FDA reviewers are not Shiny app developers and it is unlikely that the FDA would want to go down that path. GB asked for clarity on the term “independent reproducibility”. PS noted that running the sponsors code in the same environment used by the sponsor is not considered to be independent verification.\nNL asked about specific use cases that may be of interest to the FDA. PS noted that standing up a Shiny app in a real product submission workflow would be more complicated than one might expect because it would have to be integrated into an FDA contractor’s workflow. Using the current infrastructure, it is best to think of a Shiny app being run on an individual’s computer.\nThe discussion turned to the use of containers for submissions. JR asked PS whether about the FDA landscape for containers. PS replied that currently podman has been approved by NCTR, and that if we would like to use that he would have to get approval for CDAR use. Docker is not viable in the short term because of the subscription model, which would require coordination among multiple offices.\nER noted that in addition to podman and Docker he had identified singularity as a possible candidate container technology, but that this product is not as accessible to developers. In his organization, singularity requires an IT administrator to setup. PS noted that if this working group would identify a preferred container technology, he could begin promoting our choice within the FDA.\nYZ asked if we should think about writing up the Pilot 1 and Pilot 2 experience for a journal publication, perhaps a two page letter. The group liked the idea and suggested R journal, ASA Journals, Significance, Chance, DIA Journals, JSS, JAMA and a clinical trials journal were suggested as possibilities.\nNL asked about the possibility of presenting to FDA statisticians. PS said that he would have to consult with FDA management.\nPS suggested something like the recent R Adoption Series Webinar which drew 600 people from industry would be viable. He would invite members of the internal FDA Statistics Association to attend. He suggested a discussion / capstone effort: “Working through the R Consortium industry and the FDA have collaborated with industry in an appropriate way and gone through a step by step process that has involved the FDA at each step.\nAction Item JR and NL to arrange this webinar.\nNext the grouped discussed whether it would be worthwhile to do an additional pilot that would include data generation. The idea would be to start with CDISC SDTM data and derive the data for analysis such as change from baseline etc. PS said that this would be interesting, but that most reviewers start with the analysis data steps. More motivated reviewers will trace key variables to show that they can be independently reproduced. No decision was reached on this matter.\nPS suggested that the WG consider participating in the CDISC TFL Designer Virtual Workshop which will be held on 13 September 2022, 11am - 2pm Eastern Time. Register Here.\nAction Item The group will try to find someone from CDISC who may involved and also search for someone from the working group who might want to attend. JR will write to James Black to see if he has any knowledge of the event.\nThe next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, September 2, 2022."

Currently the team is testing the submission with teal, fixing some bugs identified in the last review, packaging the Shiny app into golem and working on the reviewer guidance documents. Ning expects that the submission team will be ready to release Pilot 2 for a wider review among the entire working group soon after that. The Pilot 2 Shiny app is available in the submissions-pilot2 repository and the minutes from this technical sub working group are available under the Wiki tab.\nEric Nantz has been developing the Shiny app in a Linux Docker container but will spin up a Windows container for testing. He and Ellis Hughes suggested that it may be possible to do some automated testing with GitHub actions and the shinytest2 package.\nJBR Suggested that we have two stories to tell: the submission itself and the assembly of the submission and the workflows developed to support it.\nEric pointed out that Roche releasing the teal framework to open source is a big deal and a success story for the industry. Gabe Becker remarked that he believes that teal was a joint effort among several companies and theRoche intends to present it as such. Ning suggested contacting James Black and Tadeusz Lewandowski about Roche’s communication plan for teal.\nPaul Schuette suggested checking with the FDA gateway team to make sure there are no issues and also suggested clarifying the intent of the Shiny app and asked if it is targeted towards a statistical reviewer or clinical reviewer?\nAction items\nNext, JBR asked if there was any update on the effort to work with the Japanese or Chinese regulatory agencies. Ning mentioned that with respect to Japan, Roche is working with the Japanese non-profit organization JPMA. Two main discussion are:\nJBR if we should invite someone from the Japan team to visit our group. Ning suggested that this might be possible towards the end of the year.\nJBR asked Gregory Chen if he would give an update on his investigations with respect to HTA agencies. Greg reviewed the contents of a recent email on this subject that he sent to JBR. The relevant text of Greg’s email is included as an Addendum below.\nFinally, there was a short discussion about what could be done to make progress on using containers. Paul noted that the FDA NCTR has approved the limited use of ‘podman’, and offered to check with his IT contacts about efforts within the FDA that may be relevant. Eric emphasized that we will need to be open minded in looking for solutions in this area.\nThe next meeting of the submissions working group will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, August 3, 2022."

He described how he received an email from the FDA about canceling the ticket for the ESG and asked if this was a problem. The email which was sent by the ESG help desk on 7/22/2021 read:\nTicket 275030: [EXTERNAL] Re: New WebTrader Test Account Registration Your ticket (275030) has been closed.

She began with an overview of the documents in the new repository https://github.com/RConsortium/r-submission-site\nSome highlights of Ning’s overview:\n\nAll work will be done in the open with the R Consortium being the sponsor for the pilot submissions.\nThe submission package will not favor any one company. R packages used should be either open source or packages developed by multiple companies.\nThree different pilots are planned, each one being more ambitious than the previous.\nNing and Yilong estimate three months to do the submission\nWe need to set up the account with the FDA\nThere is a project board summarizing the tasks.\nAn R Markdown document describes the project\nIt is envisioned that the r-submission-site will be public facing and user friendly\n\nThere was a discussion about how much documentation needs to go into the phase 1 Pilot. Yilong noted that the a CSR and other materials have already been submitted in the CDISC pilot and since we are only submitting R versions of some of the SAS tables in the CDISC pilot we can refer to those.\nSome of the CDISC documents have already been placed into the Pilot 1 package.\nAdrian asked for clarification about the differences between Pilot 1 and Pilot 2. Ning said they were thinking to include and analysis package in Pilot 2. Adrian also suggested including reviewer aids in Pilots 2 and 3, including Shiny apps and the like.\nThe conversation shifted to what was required to get the FDA account set up. Paul suggested consulting with Ethan’s group. Ning took the Action Item to ask the Roche submissions team what needs to be done.\nAdrian suggested that we augment the project board to reflect To Do, In Progress, Done\nJoe granted maintainer privileges for the submissions-wg repo to the following members of the WG: Eli Miller, Yilong Zhang, Eric Nantz, Ning Leng, Adrian Waddell.\nAdrian then set up the Kanban board in real time. Ning and Yilong will populate the Kanban with the tasks they defined.\nWe are not able to use the credentials above to access the FDA account. Sorting this out was assigned as a task on the Kanban board.\nThe second half of the video of the meeting includes Adrian showing how to use the projects board.\nThe zoom recording is available.

Tad L. noted teal will have an Apache 2.0 license.\nTad Lewandowski noted that the Pilot 2 execution team received several helpful comments on the shiny app. The team plans to keep the initial app as simple as possible and will consider the ideas proposed in the comments as extensions for the future. He also noted hat the Roche team has built additional shiny apps that have been made public and are available for use in future submissions that collectively form a “clinical studies results viewer”.

As part of her evaluation she tried launching the app in different machines to compare results. She saw some inconsistency between the environments, and they will report specific findings by next month (February)\n\n\n\nPilot 3 Update\n\nProposal was sent in early December for comments and feedback https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/37\nRunning into minor issues with using the same specifications and define settings as the original Pilot 1\nThey are not clear on the most up-to-date specifications to use for the AdAM creation, would like help from others\nThomas found a Phuse 2017 white paper on transport files for the next generation. This paper proposed new ways to convert the data before transfer\nAdditional ideas such as a proposal to use JSON format https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/ODM2/Dataset-JSON\nFDA is aware of the proposal, but it is not clear how far the proposal has gone\nStudy Data Technical Conformance Guide details the latest specs and what is acceptable in the gateway https://www.fda.gov/media/162867/download\nSponsors can use SAS version 8 of XPT if they choose, most sponsors are using version 5 from their experience\nOther pilots have explored alternative formats, but have not been satisfactory in their opinion\nIt is common to convert the XPT format to a more consumable format. For instance as sas7bdat in SAS or R objects inside R.\nPilot 3 will adhere to the current specifications\nBen recommended consulting with Sam Hume as a collaborate to push the effort along\nThe ectd gateway would need updating to accommodate json formats. That would require discussions with the E-data team in the FDA\n\n\n\nR Validation Hub intro to Repositories working group\n\nDoug Kelkhoff and Kevin Kunzmann led a an introduction to the mission and goals of the working group\nMission is to support a transparent cross-industry approach of maintaining a repo of R packages with evidence of their quality and assessment criteria\nRepo structure may resemble pieces of CRAN, R Universe . Still in the early stages of finding what is needed before working on the technical solutions\nAsks for regulatory input: Work with the team to understand how you want to observe quality. Paul mentioned that bigger issues that FDA are thinking about are from the IT perspective (making sure that packages don’t compromise infrastructure). Example of haven running into buffer overflow issues. Typically those concerns are raised by security team colleagues. They are not aware of any independent effort to gauge the quality of an R package. Typically they point people to the R Validation Hub. While it is not doing independent replication of algorithms, it is a reasonable attempt in the right direction. Typically all pieces of software give you the “as-is” message and no implied guarantee of quality\nAsks for industry input: Contribute by direct support, or by intermittent feedback as they prepare deliverables\nHigh level of planned deliverables: List of quality criteria, mockup of the communication portal, and an example of a package server modelling a real-world workflow\nVisit the repository to get involved https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg\nBen asked about ways to consolidation various validation efforts heard from other sponsors. What existing tools are being implemented in this space?\nDoug shared an article from the ASA Biopharmaceutical Report regarding the risk assessment of R packages: https://www.pharmar.org/blog/2022/12/05/2022-12-05-asa-biopharmaceutical-report-fall-2022/"

Detailed information on the R Validation Hub project which is also organized as an R Consortium working group can be found here.\nNext, Nan Xiao of Merck gave an overview and demo of the R package pkglite which is expected to be up on CRAN soon.\nThe specific aims of the package are:\n\nAim 1: To provide a tool for packing and restoring R packages as plaintext assets that are easy to store, transfer, and review.\nAim 2: To provide a grammar for specifying the file packing scope that is functional, precise, and extendable.\nAim 3: To provide a standard for exchanging the packed asset that is unambiguous, human-friendly, and machine-readable.\n\nNan’s presentation can be found in the Document’s section of the R Consortium/submissions-wg GitHub repository.\nYilong stated that he hoped that our working group could collaborate on a pilot submission to the FDA. He prepared the following outline to be included in these minutes.\nGoal: prepare a open source dummy submission and submit to eCTD portal\nThe information below is to track potential high level action items. Individual issues can be created to track the progress later.\nData source: CDISC pilot submission\nR program for table listing and figure (TLFs): program\nGeneral action items:\n\nMake sure this use case is following CDISC terms of use\nIdentify TLFs in-scope for submission\n\nAction items for dummy submission package preparation:\n\nIdentify point of contact to initiate dummy submission request\nPrepare analysis results metadata\nPrepare step-by-step instruction to re-run analysis based on code in program folder and put in ADRG: link\nWrap-up submission package\n\nThose present all seemed to be enthusiastic about cooperating on the generating a dummy submission.\nNext, followed a lengthy discussion on the required process. Mike Stackhouse suggested that we work with PHUSE to suggest people who may be knowledgeable about past CDISC submissions. Paul Schuette recommended Zak Skrivanek.\nYilong Zhang mentioned that Merck intends to use this package as part of a pilot oncology submission in the near future. Bella mentioned that the FDA Oncology group had specified SAS.\nNing Leng of mentioned that Roche is preparing a rare disease submission for 2022.\nJoe Rickert asked the group: assuming the pkglite dummy submission is successful, how far the this would advance us towards the ultimate goal of an all R submission.\nWhile everyone was very excited about the pkglite all agreed with Doug Kelkhoff’s sober assessment that the industry would ultimately want a more “R idiomatic” solution that took advantage of R naming conventions and did not introduce special requirements for R package maintenance.\nMike Stackhouse noted that a successful pkglite submission would break down a significant barrier to R submissions, but that there were other hurdles. Nevertheless, he asserted that it would be a significant advance to be able to say here is “how” you can do an R submission.\nIt the few minutes that remained, Joe Rickert brought the groups attention to the copy of the word document containing the text of section 4.1.2.10 of the FDA document pertaining to software and asked everyone mark up the document to suggest ideal wording from the industry’s point of view.\nThe group agreed to met next on Friday April 1, at 9AM Pacific time.\nThe zoom recording of this meeting is available here (Passcode: d9N%+JWY)."

Time stamps in the Minutes refer to the video.\n\n\nMinutes\nJoseph Rickert opened the meeting at 9AM Pacific Time and told the group that Mike Stackhouse has revised the document for a pilot submission which is in the document folder of the GitHub repo. He asked Mike to give an overview.\n1:10 Mike’s Overview: The Submissions Working Group should make the opportunity to test out the pkglite package and try to get a pilot submission through the eCTD gateway. The objective would be to determine if an FDA reviewer would be able to receive and consume the content. This effort would be a discovery process exposing unanticipated problems in getting an R submission through the gateway and help to identify difficulties an FDA consumer would have in replicating the outputs of the pilot.\nMike stated that having a concrete example of pushing an R submission through the gateway would be “momentous”.\n6:37 Joe asks Paul Schuette if he agrees with Mike’s assessment of the benefits of the pilot. Paul affirms that it would be helpful and suggest using a simulated data set.\n7:55 Joe asks Paul if special preparation would have to happen on the receiving side. Paul replies that it would depend on the processes and procedures of gateway, and notes that in the past the authorities have asked for submissions by DVD and mail (This came up last year with respect to submitting University COVID tests.)\n11:03 Paul recommends putting in a formal request to involve additional agency reviewers. Mike suggests that submitting through Phuse would have some advantages since Phuse has a structured relationship with the FDA.\n12:53 Based on previous experience, Paul states that his is not certain about the efficacy of the Phuse relationship, but that he does not have serious objections\n15:06 Paul raises the possibility that the R Consortium could sponsor the pilot. Doug Kelkhoff, Yilong Zhang and others endorse this idea.\nAdrian Waddell asks how difficult is it to make a submission? Paul replies that he is not sure, but adds that to his knowledge at least one foundation has made a submission in the past. He advises we would have to reach out to group that manages gateway and EDR, and remarks that the R Consortium may have resource issues that pharma company does not have.\n17:37 Adrian alternative:\n\nSplit out the data and analysis code which need to be secure and go through gateway process.\nPut the code that does not involve patient level data on a public Github repository and devise a secure way to give the agency access.\n\n19:35 Paul describes a similar process he and Eric went through with a Lilly pilot where Paul had access to a Lilly Github site for 8 hours. This was a process that agency was able to handle with Eric’s help, but it was a one-off effort as part of CID pilot and not a typical submission. He speculates that the process would probably not be allowed as part of standard submission package.\n26:09 Mike brings the conversation back to logistics of getting a submission number to get the pilot process started.\n27:24 Joe asks if it is possible for more than one company to make joint submission and Doug clarifies this to mean have multiple companies co-sponsor a submission. He that the word “Sponsor” has a technical meaning to the FDA and that the system is set up for sponsors to be a company. The group agrees that the ideal would be to have R Consortium be the surrogate sponsor of the pilot.\n28:48 Paul suggests that we assess the possibility of having the R Consortium sponsor by reaching out to Ethan Chen who heads up the Division of Data Management Services and Solutions. Doug suggests that we invite Ethan, or someone designated by him to our next meeting.\nPaul notes that the invitation should be a formal process and suggests that as the representative of the R Consortium Joe write to Ethan to ask his group to participate in the process of planning for a pilot submission. Paul suggests that the letter could reference him and that the content of the letter emphasize that our group is part of an industry effort to help enhance and modernize submission tools. We are independent of, but in line with the recent Transcelerate MSA framework and the work being done by the R Validation Hub. Both of these efforts provide some justification as to why companies and consortia are interested the submissions process.\n34:37 Joe agrees write the email letter. Doug, Eric and other agree to help with drafting it.\n40:40 a discussion about whether approvals need to be obtained from the individual pharmaceutical companies\nAdrian points out that we would want to be able to try multiple approaches, and Paul indicates that an advantage of having the R Consortium sponsor would be to have multiple updates on the same submission number. It can sometimes take some companies multiple efforts to get something through the gateway\n46:53 Adrian asks when we make a solution how does the analysis code access the data? Paul replies that the standard is to have an M5 folder to hold CDISC tabular data and analysis data - code can be in separate folder or along with analysis data sets.\n51:00 Adrian describes the main goal to give health authorities something that they can easily use themselves.\n51:30 states the measure of success : Deliver something like like the CDISC package through eTCD and have and FDA reviewer recreate and install packages and reproduce the results\n54:41 Doug advises that the letter be general with no technical detail stating the R Consortium’s interest in being a sponsor and asking for agency participation.\nAction item Joe to draft letter and place it in the documents folder of the submissions repo by Tuesday of next week. The team will review and comment.\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here Passcode: Gb#E@4$S"

The details are:\nThe R Consortium account has been reactivated: To access the R Consortium account, please, use this URL: https://esgtest.fda User ID: joseph.rickert@rstudio.com Password: Please see Ning, Yilong, Eli or Joe The Portal is : https://esgtest.fda.gov/\nHe then asked Ning to introduce Beverly Chin from Roche and Tim Powell from Biogen who are both experienced in making regulatory submissions.\nNing provided a brief overview of the project and an update on progress since the last meeting which included recruiting new members for the working group from presenting at the R/Pharma conference and a new project website (https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/) built by Eric Nantz.\nAsks to members We need more people to review the submission package. Bob Engle volunteered Nate Mockler (nate.mockler@biogen.com) as a reviewer. Identify FDA members who can do the review. (Paul said that he has two candidates.)\nBeverly asked some clarifying questions and we confirmed that We are using the test gateway CDER will be the center It is a formal package\nNing then went over some feedback provided by reviewers so far. The most important issue was Inconsistent table layouts. However, Ning pointed out that using multiple table layouts is intentional. The objective is to have three tables follow different company specific standards in order to cover tables built with different R packages. Ning said that we will add a disclaimer to the report in order to inform the FDA reviewers of our objectives.\nReviewers also flagged some things that are not consistent with best practices, such as including the number of individuals at risk on Kaplan-Meier curves.\nJoe asked Ning to review the contents of the Pilot 1 repo\nNing explained the reviewer comments on issue #47 on the Kanban Board. Ning will link the GitHub issue to a google drive containing more material.\nThe group then discussed a timeline for the remainder of the project and settled on the key dates: Package to be complete and ready to go by end of Friday, 2021-11-19 Submission to be made on Monday 2021-11-22 Joe took the action item to setup a zoom meeting for 9AM PT time on 11-22\nThere followed an extended discussion about whether to use .txt or .r for the R files. The FDA documentation says they will accept both, however, some people Including FDA folks might reject a .r file because they misunderstand the documentation. On the other hand, getting a .r through would be a big win on its own.\nIt was also suggested to include a separate README document to describe how the package is constructed.\nAt 36.33 into the video Paule Schuette of the FDA shares a slide his colleague Heather Crandall presented recently at the R/Pharma conference about eCTD placement of Study Data Files.\n\n\n\nCTD triangle\n\n\nNote that R Markdown and R are listed among accepted eCTD format types.\nAt 44.33, “Scrum master” Adrian Waddell leads the group through adding new tasks to the Kanban board: https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/projects/2\nSummary of tasks leading to Submission\nFirst round of adjudication by 2021-11-11 Decide about submitting .r files 2021-11-11 Adjudication by 2021-11-18 Final Review 2021-11-19 by Eric Nantz, Adrian and Nate Mockler Ning and Yilong will address the comments. Submission on 2021-11-22 Ning Leng, Yilong Zhang, Paul Schuette, Beverely Chin, Tim Powell and Joe Rickert will participate in the Submission meeting. The meeting will be recorded.\nJoe took the action item to setup a zoom meeting for 9AM PT time on 2021-11-22 to make the submission.\nThe video of today’s 11-5-21 meeting is available here passcode: L*jwHXn5\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Friday, 2021-12-03."

He mentioned that Eli Miller reported although we do have credentials to use the FDA submissions gateway, these have timed out. Reactivating gateway access requires that I send an email to the FDA help desk. Eli recommends that I wait until we are nearly ready to submit before doing this.\nNext, Ning Leng presented the recently up dated slides describing the R Submissions Pilot. Ning will upload this slides to the repo.\n\nThe slides include the working time line for the series of pilot submissions:\n\nPilot1: common analysis (Q4 2021 - hopefully Oct/early Nov)\nPilot2: advanced analysis (Q2 2022)\nPilot3: alternative formatting for package submission (TBD)\n\nTimeline for near term work: * 9/30/2021 complete the draft code and documents along with the internal review by the execution team * 10/1 - 10/15 2021: review by the WG * Late Oct: actual submission after adjudication\nThe two major asks from the execution team: 1. WG members: provide feedback during the review in Oct 2. FDA: Identify potential reviewers\nNext, there was a discussion about the content of the submission package and terminology. (9:48 in the video). This discussion also contains and explanation of the strategy for encoding the R package as a text file to get it through the gateway and how we will handle package dependencies.\nIn our documentation and communication we must be careful to distinguish between the Submission package for the pilot and the R Package containing R code that will be a part of the Submission package. Ning and the team will come up with names for both of these maybe: Pilot1 Submission for the Pilot1 Submission Package. The format for the Submission package will match the folder structure for the submission portal.\nJoe then noted that we now have two R Consortium GitHub repositories associated with the working group. 1. https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg is the primary repository for the working group. The Kanban board project on this repo is what we use to manage the submissions project. 2. The repo https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1 is the code development repo for the Pilot1 submission.\nNext, Adrian walked through the status of the tasks on the Kanban Board. (20:19 on the video).\nJoe will write a blog post to describing what the submission team is doing with the intention of getting more pharma companies before the submission. Mike Stackhouse will help with getting it through the PHUSE marketing channels.\nThere was a discussion (43:30) about finding an FDA reviewer for the pilot. Paul Schuette took the action item to find someone who will probably be a statistician but not a formally designated FDA reviewer. It was suggested that the criteria for reviewing the pilot submission and the criteria for the success of the project be included in the cover letter.\nJoe asked what would be required to communicate the success of the pilot. Paul stated that formal approval from the FDA would be required for a press release and that the project should be included as part of the FDA’s Technology Modernization Action Plan (T-MAP) and the Data Modernization Action Plan (D-MAP). It would be best to investigate this after we have the proof of concept of the Pilot1.\nIn response to the question if eventually we would want to have the pilot reviewed by a formal FDA reviewer, Paul noted that they have several R competent FDA reviewers especially among the new graduates. However, if a reviewer need help they would most likely reach out to the Paul’s group.\nWhen asked whether would expect reviewers to compare SAS and R results, Paul suggested that we should focus on a limited definition of validation for our first submission.\nWhen asked whether we should have a future goal of having FDA reviewers to take the code in the submission package and and do further analyses, Paul stated that they can do that now. More interesting would be to have the submission package include a Shiny application for interactive data visualization.\nAt the top of the hour Joe asked whether anyone on the call was involved with preparing a presentation about the Submissions project for the upcoming R / Pharma conference. Paul responded that he may be. The FDA is still working out the details of a keynote talk in which Paul will participate. The group extended an offer to help provide material.\nThe group agreed to extend the meeting beyond the hour to review Ning’s proposal for language to be added to section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide. (1:03 on video) Ning suggested adding:\n\nSubmission of programs with their native file extensions are acceptable, as long as binary file formats and pre-compilde code are not delivered.\n\nPaul stated that .bat files need to be excluded. This launched a discussion of how to generalize this. Paul suggested executable but Doug noted that .bat files are executable on Windows but not on other operating systems. Doug took the action to consider how to describe the issue in a more general fashion. Paul expressed the essential idea as “We can open it, we can look at it, but we don’t want it to run.”\nIn the final minutes, Adrian asked about not having to submit .txt files. Paul suggested that this would require changes within the Agency, and would probably require getting the suggested changes to 4.1.2.10 passed.\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Friday, October 1, 2020. At that meeting we will decide whether we need a special session to provide material for Paul’s presentation.\nThe zoom video recording is available. Passcode: #Sk!6tXL"

Every submission will have two repositories: a development repo and a repo that follows the FDA ECTD structure that contains the files that will go through the gateway.\n\nsubmissions-wg is he umbrella repo that contains the kanban board for the project.\nsubmissions-pilot1 is the development repository for the Pilot 1 submission\nsubmission-pilot1-to-fda contains the only the files that will go to the FDA\nsubmissions-pilot2 is the development repo for Pilot 2\n[https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot2]\n\nThe group then summarized the present status of the project. The Pilot 1 submission of last year was mostly successful but the FDA response flagged a couple of problem areas: * An apparent but the resulted in column labels being switched * An unexplained rounding discrepancy in a p-value may be due to different operating systems. * Several good practice issues to address\nHSC who helped to conduct the FDA review of the Pilot 1 submission offered to share the code that flagged the rounding error. She will enter it as an issue on the submissions repo.\nThe Pilot 1 team has been working on the Pilot 1 resubmission. The team will will review the FDA code and test it on multiple operating systems. They expect to be able to resubmit in a couple of weeks. NL asked if HSC could look over the new code before they do so. Assuming that the resubmission goes well the group will prepare a blog for posting on the RC blog.\nNL then reviewed plans of the Pilot 2 shiny submission. It is envisioned as a simple four tab Shiny app that contains the same analyses as the previous submission. The plan is to use the Roche teal framework because of its filtering structure.\nYZ then outlined work required to complete the Pilot 2 work and identified three dependencies:\n\nteal must become open source\nThe scope of Pilot 2 needs to be clarified\nA template needs to be developed for submission documentation that includes a Shiny app.\n\nYZ recommended that a separate Pilot 2 documentation team be formed to work on the Shiny documentation in parallel with the code development for Pilot 2.\nEN said that he had experience preparing this sort of documentation and agreed to lead the documentation task.\nJR asked when teal would become open source and whether the fact that it is not now open source prohibiting other companies from contributing to the project. TL responded that project to open source teal is currently with the Roche lawyers and that he expects it will be complete within three months. No one present believed that not currently having teal as open source code was prohibiting participation. Everyone will be able to run the Shiny app from a public website. EN noted that work on infrastructure can proceed in parallel.\nThe team working on Pilot 2 said that a submission in Q2 is feasible.\nCurrently there are not plans for multiple Pilot 2 submissions. However, it is likely that we would want to have a submission in the future that includes a more complicated Shiny app. JR noted that it would be optimal if the FDA could provide guidance on what features they would like to see in a more robust Shiny app.\nMoving beyond Shiny JR asked if by the end of the year we would be looking a submission based on container technology. EN remarked that that is the direction the group would like to see but since Docker is not suitable (because of licensing issues) it will be necessary to research alternative container technology.\nJR noted that having 29 people in the meeting indicated that there was considerable industry interest in the work being done and whether it would be possible to recruit a team to do the research for long range projects. He asked group members who are not involved in immediate work to get involved in long term planning. EN noted that we definitely need to help from the regulatory side to help effect any changes that would have to be made to make use of container technology.\nThe discussion then turned to the possibility of making a submission to CDE the Chinese health authority. (See issue #62 ) They are trying their own submissions gateway. They have shared validation software with Roche that could check a submission. NL suggested that we undertake an effort to see if we could validate a test submission using the Chinese supplied software. If that worked the only additional work to be done to make a viable submission to the CDE would be to translate the documentation into Chinese.\nNL asked if anyone has contacts with the CDE that could review a test submission from the Submissions WG. JR asked EN if she could check with PS about possible FDA contacts with the CDE.\nBF noted that her company, EQRx, has the opposite problem. They have had a compound approved by the CEA and now want to submit it to the FDA. She noted that there are high level regulations about the transfer of data between China and the FDA. The CDE has an HGR application that must be approved by the Human Genetic Resources Agency for China. HY offered that she has some experience dealing with the CDE, having done two or three submissions to the CED in the past when she worked for Novartis. At that time the CDE accepted the FDA package.\nThe discussion they turned to other countries HY noted that she is working on a submission to the Japanese PMDA which the group aggreed is more strict than the CDE an offered to look for a contact there.\nYL noted that the German authorities have strict requirements about the table formats.\nJR asked if there is there is a European authority that we should have on our radar. Apparently, the EMA does not presently require a data submission, but that may be changing. TL noted that they have had a proof of concept sharing data with the EMA.\nYL also raised the possibility of following the PHUSE ADGR template. He suggested that we contact PHUSE and ask if they would be willing to update the template so that it does not specify SAS data sets. JR agreed to look for a contact within PHUSE. We would want a language agnostic template.\nNL noted that this would be a good time to revisit our effort to develop suggested language for section 14 (issue #38).\nJR suggested that we need some high level planning document to capture all of the ideas presented.\nAt 47:10 in the video NL explains the contents of the Submission WG GI Hub sites.\n\nSome useful links from the chat box\nR Consortium GitHub sites: https://github.com/RConsortium/\nWG web page: https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/\nTracker for the pilot1 submission: https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda/issues\nhttps://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/issues/38\nIssue filed for pilot 2 documentation : https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/issues/63"

JR asked if there are external groups that we should involve. Michael Stackhouse and Paul Schuette suggest linking up with PHUSE. JR asks for a recommendation from PHUSE, MS offers to investigate.\nJR asked PS if he could elaborate on requirements from various government agencies. Paul recommends contacting Wendy Martinez of BLS, and leader of the Inter-Agency R Users Group.\nPS also notes that declining budgets in various government agencies are forcing declining budgets and that consequently there is a renewed interest in open source. There is particular interest in establishing a stable R environment and the whole panoply of tools required.\nJR noted that although other federal agencies are not directly involved in setting requirements for R submissions they must have some say in setting general requirements and technology standards and asked PS if he could elaborate on the hierarchy of federal agencies involved. PS stated that the government has a federated model. Groups tend to do their own thing. The FDA has some standards that are not uniformly enforced. They are center specific. CDER and CBER are the two centers that are most closely linked. Require CDISC heading towards STDTM, ADaM and other data standards. CDRH has a more heterogeneous sponsor group and even gets some submissions in Excel.\nCVM is in between. Other centers like CPT don’t much deal with clinical trials. Paul’s presentation (from last time) focused on CDER and CBER and the portals and gateways that have been set up there. Even within the his center the Office of Biostatistics does not control the standards FDA submissions gateway uses.\nThere are two different types of standards: there are the standards of CDISC and PHUSE and then there are the standards of “What does one have to do to actually submit through the electronics gateway”.\nEric Nantz asks if the group that is handling the gateway is also in CDER and CBER. PS replied that it is, but in a different office. (At 11:21 PS elaborates on which groups are involved.) The actual gateway is under the Office of Business Informatics which is in the Office of Strategic Programs. It is a Balkanized setup. Primary tool for clinicians in the Office of New Drugs is JMP clinical, script in Python, some code in SAS and R.\nAnything with inferential statistics falls to the Office of Biostatistics. Safety issues are mostly done elsewhere by clinicians.\nProject PORTES has a provision for a submissions portal and also includes turning XPT data sets into S or R data sets. PS recommends getting Ethan Chen involved, but in short term writing program that modifies scripts (e.g. from .lower case to .Upper case) would be faster approach.\nEN and PS note that the discussions last time (see the presentation by Yilong Zhang) made it clear that industry is already working on this approach and suggest that it may be worth pursuing.\nJR (22:29) suggested that we may want to pursue the idea of setting up a stable R environment. YZ says Merck is working on a package to assemble functions into a txt file, and stated that once they have a stable version they would be willing to discuss making it open source.\nJR suggests that going for a stable R environment would pull together several threads of work in progress, and asked if setting up a pilot server with an R environment configured similarly to an environment typically used for submissions would be helpful. PS said that he thought so and referenced (26:30) a project he and EN did a couple of years ago to stand up a stable snapshot.\nYZ argues for making a purely open source setup. YZ and EN suggest (48:30) that we could setup a repo with software to CDISC tables and synthetic data for a hypothetical submission and we could collaborate and show how it could scale to do a real submission.\nPS noted that a project he and Doug Kelkhoff worked on to use Docker had issues with mixing environment like Windows and Linux. PS noted that he is constrained to use a particular version of Windows 10.\nPS likes the idea of having a common repo that includes a class of standard packages. Mike Stackhouse notes that the problem is to have the right structure, packages and package management. MS notes that there are several package management solutions available\nJames Black asks Paul (33:00) how identical solutions have to be. There was some discussion about this. PS notes opinions vary between 100% identical and having results close enough so as not to change the decision. (e.g. p = 0.019 and p = 0.19 are clearly different, but there is a lot of gray area.)\nEN notes it is possible to lock down what goes into a container that would minimize risk even OS differences, but states that getting things stable at the R package level is the bigger issue. (There seemed to be general agreement about this.) DK says locking downing the R environment using packrat or rn would give us a foothold. If this is successful we could reproduce the same environment in a container.\nDK noted that many of difficulties he and PS had during previous FDA project had to do with mounting a file system and how data is accessed within the FDA. Suggests bundling packages with base environment.\nMS asked if part of project would be to show that the pilot gives same results in Windows and Linux. PS indicates that it would.\nJR notes that there is a consensus for a pilot, and states that even if pilot did not address everything it would be a good start, and asks those present to uses the repo to suggest ideas and contribute relevant documents.\n\nAction Items\nJR takes action items to reach out to:\n\nPHUSE\nWendy Martinez\nToma Drogen (ORA deals with field inspectors)\n\n\n\nNext meeting\nAll agree on 9AM Pacific Time February 5th.\n\n\nVideo Recording\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here The passcode is oM5YqkM\n\n\nNote from Doug Kelkhoff\nIn a private communication after the meeting Doug Kelkhoff contributed the following:\nAt today’s meeting, Paul mentioned a pilot that he and I worked on to share docker containers. It would be great if I could share that code with you all. I reached out to the lead from the PHUSE working group to see if we can get that code uploaded somewhere where I can share it.\nA brief summary of what was done:\n\nDelivery of a docker-compose build script, chosen for transparency and to adhere to plain-text restrictions of delivery content. It consisted of:\n\nbase image based on rocker shiny+tidyverse image\n\na small cohort of packages to install\na mock analysis and companion shiny app\ndata access (which ended up being the problematic piece of the puzzle)\n\nWe encountered a few data access woes:\n\nwe first attempted to mount a data directory within the eCTD, which prompted for escalated administrator privileges on windows machines - not an acceptable solution\nthe second attempt was to build the data into the container image, which we were unfortunately not able to fully test before Paul had to move on to other priorities.\n\n\nOverall, I still have confidence that this method could work, but, as Paul mentioned, the “it works on my machine” method of trying to debug across platforms and administrated systems is both frustrating and time intensive. Remotely teasing apart docker-related issues from system administration restrictions without a clear picture of the systems constraints was quite a challenge."

Paul also noted that although it might be possible it is not likely that the FDA could accomplish the task requested before the R/Pharma conference which begins on November 2. Those present agreed that it is not necessary to tie the completion of the FDA activities to R/Pharma.\nAfter Ning’s presentation there was a discussion about suggestions for amending the language to section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide. Doug Kelkhoff noted that in internal discussions within Genentech the idea was floated that, as written the document may already allow passing R code in tar balls through the FDA gateway. If this were indeed true it would greatly simply R submissions since tar balls are a common method of delivering R code. Jian Xu of the FDA suggest that the way to get an answer to this question is to submit the question to the email address provided on the FDA eCTD webpage: Submit an eCTD or Standardized Data Sample to the FDA. Joe and Doug took the action item to write up the question and submit it.\nThe group then considered a proposal by Adrian to organize the several GitHub repositories and activities of the Submissions WG using the Teams features of GitHub. The group agreed that this would be a good idea but suggested waiting until after Pilot1 is completed. Adrian will set up a meeting with Joe and Ning to setup the structure.\nThe video of today’s 10-1-21 meeting is available here passcode: &1b4VEkR\nThe next meeting of the WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday November 5, 2021."

Paul Schuette agreed with this. He noted that the experiment he did with Eric Nantz two years ago (discussed in a previous meeting) was the closest he has come so far.\nNext followed a discussion about the FDA computing environment, a discussion thread that developed over the course of the meeting. Some key points are:\n\nFDA reviewers and researchers work primarily on desktop machines that mostly run Windows 10.\nThere are two classes of desktop computers 1) regulatory computers and 2) scientific computers.\nThe scientific computers are not as rigorously controlled as the scientific computers.\nPaul has installed Ubuntu on a few of the scientific computers\nDesktop computers run SAS version 9.4, but the build may differ\nA perceived advantage of SAS is that it generally runs older software\nThere is a pilot project going on at the FDA to run SAS on a server, which would ensure a common build.\nWhen asked: If the FDA decided to move to Linux, how long would it take to convert all of the desktops from Windows to Linux, Paul speculated that it would take a minimum of two years. The implication is that Windows is not going away anytime soon.\nWhen asked about the installation of R packages, Paul indicated that installation was not a problem.\nObtaining R packages is more of an issue. In theory, the FDA could use MRAN or some other repository which enables downloading specific versions of packages.\n\nThe discussion turned to considering section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide:\n\nYilong Zhang stated that his company has focused on the sentence: “The Specific Software utilized should be specified in the ADRG.” Mike Stackhouse explained that the PHUSE working group is is leading is also focused on interpreting this sentence.\nPaul noted that companies are obligated to use the SAS export file format, but are not obligated to use SAS. Bella Feng noted that a recent FDA oncology pilot explicitly specifies SAS.\nPaul noted that many FDA analyses are hybrid using both SAS and R. The group acknowledge that all R submissions were the ultimate goal, we should be planning to work with mixed submissions for some time.\nMike Stackhouse stated that, although there are many corner cases, we should focus on building a reference platform along the lines of least resistance and go for what is easily achievable. The group generally agreed with this.\nTowards the end of the meeting Paul mentioned that although the that section 4.1.2.10 specifies that programs should be submitted as text files, it does not mean that .txt extensions must be used. This surprised everyone. When asked if the FDA document could be revised to make this more clear, Paul stated that it was possible. He said that the document is generally revised once or twice a year, the most recent revision is dated Nov 20, 2020.\nAction Item: Paul stated that if the group wanted to suggest the wording to revise the document, he would submit it to the responsible FDA committee. He noted that to make the change it would need to be approved by the committee and go through the normal approval process.\nJoseph Rickert asked the group to use the repo to submit their suggested changes to the wording about using text, and reminded everyone that the next meeting was set for Friday, March 5, 2021.\nJoseph Rickert, Mike Stackhouse and Sascha Ahrweiler agreed to meet before the next Submissions group meeting to try and map out the various PHUSE, PSI and R Consortium working groups that are doing similar or complementary work.\nThe link to the video of the meeting is: https://zoom.us/rec/share/gFQancacysPFHm0Czrw3sAYOCrt35BgTbcodBdY2LGld4fkykDypkL99PX5o0i-c.JRCWwmZfO9Ui8G6f\nPasscode: +GKR9&i6"

This software is has not yet been open sourced so it appears to be on the critical path for making the submission. teal is one of several packages that Roche and three other collaborating companies are preparing to open source. (These packages are described) in the minutes to the 5-5-2022 RTRS working group meeting that are available in the WG’s GitHub directory directory) Tad Lewandowski of Roche will investigate the possibility of open-sourcing tiel before the other packages it appears that the time line for the release of the bundle of packages is greater than two months.\nThe Pilot 2 cover letter and deployed shiny app are ready for review here Your feedback would be greatly appreciated!\nIn a month or so there will be another review round that will include the source code.\nNing also reported that the team working on the submission to the Japanese regulatory agency is seeking the help of JPMA, The Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. JBR said that, if it would be helpful , the R Consortium would be happy to contact the appropriate people from JPMA.\nNext, Gregory Chen described a potential new project: making submissions to Reimbursement Agencies in an Health Technology Assessment environment. These would be country specific efforts for example with NICE in the U.K. or IQWIG in Germany.\nIt appears that submissions to NICE are mostly done in Excel. Tad reported that the Roche Global Pricing Strategy group which does HTA submissions has learned that IQWIG is interested in subgroup analyses.\nTad also noted that in Europe, approval by the EMA, the European Medicines Agency does not mean that patients automatically get access to treatments. These must also be approved by the reimbursement agencies for the individual countries. This could take up to three years. In 2025, HTA approval process will change in Europe and IQWIG, which is a reference agency for 40 countries, will have the biggest impact on the new process.\nNext steps would be to * Determine who is interested in participating * Developing contacts within the various HTA agencies * Select an agency for a pilot submission\nACTION Those interested in participating in this effort, please express your interest in the Issues section of the website.\nHeidi Curinckx informed the group about a new J&J early adopter program to prepare hybrid submissions using both SAS and R. They would like to know if the FDA has any suggestions or advice.\nPaul Schuette of the FDA itself frequently works with a “hybrid model” and that there should be nothing for the FDA to oppose. He advised:\n\nDeclare package versions up front\nSpecify the operating system you are using. Most FDA reviewers will use Windows\nWork with your review division to let them know it is a hybrid submission. I reviewers are having trouble with both languages they can reach out to the group Paul works for.\n\nIn the past, hybrid submissions typically have used SAS for models and R for graphics. The FDA would like reviewers to be bilingual, put in reality people tend to specialize.\nHong Yan asked if the FDA has any problems with SAS IML code that calls into R to generate figures. Paul replied that the FDA is in the midst of a migration and hybrid calling is challenging on their server. He suggested that they flag and annotate this hybrid code with their reviewer.\nNing asked if reviewers will use their preferred language, and not necessarily the language submitted. Paul replied that this is typically the case, reviewers are free to use their language of choice: R, SAS or in a few cases STATA. He also noted that it is not uncommon for reviewers using a language different from the submitted language to run into rounding differences.\nEstella Dong asked if a reviewer is not comfortable with a language do two or three reviewers work on a single study? Paul replied that this is not common. Typically only one reviewer is a assigned for a study and if they have trouble they can reach out to the FDA for Division of Analytics and Informatics for help.\nWhen asked if a pre review is recommended. Paul replied that this is up to the individual review division. To request a preview contact the RPM, the regulary project manager assigned for the particular review. Do not make direct contact with individuals on the review team. This process protects both the review staff and the company.\nWhen asked if there have been any submissions using R. Paul replied that there are no submissions out there done completely in R.\nNext, Ning provided a summary of the DIA/FDA Biostatistics Industry and Regulatory Forum that she and Coline Zeballos attended recently. The session name was Yes you can use R for regulatory submissions and was hosted by Elena Rantou from FDA, and Brenda Crowe from Eli Lilly. There were two presentations and a panel discussion. Ryan Jung of the FDA shared his experience reviewing an R submission. He mentioned that R Markdown was helpful. He also recommended specifying details about packages used and that you should not assume that the FDA has the same computing environment as the sponsor. Coline presented on the Roche journey with using R.\nThe audience asked Ryan if docker would be a better computing environment. Ryan replied that this question would be better explored in a working group environment.\nAction: Ning and Coline will ask Ryan to give his talk as part of the part of the R Adoption series. Action: It would be helpful if the group could suggest questions or panel topics for the webinar.\nNing noted that the she has updated the wiki page of the Pilot 2 repo with the minutes from that subgroup.\nThe next meeting of the working group will be at 9 AM Pacific Time on Friday, June 3, 2022."

Suggest that the text for the first row read “Study Drug (High Dose)” or similar.\nSuggest an additional table: “Subjects Remaining in the Study” showing how dropouts proceed. (See Paul’s email of 10-27-22 for details) This might show how exploratory analysis might add value over the prespecified\nThe number of decimal places displayed in the demographic table isn’t always the same as in pilot 1.\nSuggest that the model specification information be included with the efficacy table rather than left to the app information.\n\nWe would like the app to be able to serve as a model for future submissions.\n\nEric stated that the updates appear to be relatively minor and would not be difficult to accomplish.\nThe submission team agreed to target 11-18-2022 as the target submission date.\nAction: JBR to put a 9AM 11-18-2022 on the calendar for the submission.\nJBR asked Paul to describe the boundary between a useful amount and too much interactivity in a shiny submissions app. Paul replied that it a way to think about it would be the difference between exploratory and inferential analysis. The problem with inferential analysis is the usual problem with p-values, subgroups and cherry picking. Inferential analysis is not the way to go. A Kaplan-Meier curve would be considered an exploratory safety analysis.\nWhen asked if the guidance on interactivity was likely to stand for some time or change with familiarity Paul replied that it was his personal opinion that since it is consistent with the ASA Statement on p-values it will probably stand.\nPaul also remarked that interactivity facilitating pre-specified analyses would probably be fine.\nThe following links may be helpful with understanding potential problems with on subgroup analyses:\n\nAlosh et al. (2015)\nAlosh et al. (2016)\n\nJoel Laxamana gave an update on the Pilot 3 effort:\n\nThe kickoff meeting for the team was held this past Wednesday\nThere are 13 people on the team\nThe goal of Pilot 3 is to duplicate Pilot 1 but also generate the ADaM data sets used for the TLGs in Pilot 1\nThe idea is to start with the STDM and show the traceability to ADaM\nPilot 3 will use the admiral package along with tidyverse packages.\n\nAction: Joel will add this explanatory material to the Pilot 3 GitHub repo.\nAction: Joel will send a list of Pilot 3 team members to be added to the invitation list for this meeting.\nAction: The Pilot 3 team will submit a written proposal to the FDA describing the process of unpacking the submission and setting up for analysis. The target date is to have this proposal ready for the 12-02-2022 Submissions WG meeting.\nLei Zhao asked if it would be a problem submitting data in SAS in doing the analysis in R. In general there is no problem, however the FDA suggests using a limited number of tools and using standard tools to do any translations between formats. The FDA prefers using scripted languages as opposed to using a GUI.\nNing will be presented at the R/Pharma conference on Wednesday, November 9, 2022 at 11AM Eastern Time. The next meeting of the regular meeting of the group will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, December 2, 2022."
