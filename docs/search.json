JR asked if there are external groups that we should involve. Michael Stackhouse and Paul Schuette suggest linking up with PHUSE. JR asks for a recommendation from PHUSE, MS offers to investigate.\nJR asked PS if he could elaborate on requirements from various government agencies. Paul recommends contacting Wendy Martinez of BLS, and leader of the Inter-Agency R Users Group.\nPS also notes that declining budgets in various government agencies are forcing declining budgets and that consequently there is a renewed interest in open source. There is particular interest in establishing a stable R environment and the whole panoply of tools required.\nJR noted that although other federal agencies are not directly involved in setting requirements for R submissions they must have some say in setting general requirements and technology standards and asked PS if he could elaborate on the hierarchy of federal agencies involved. PS stated that the government has a federated model. Groups tend to do their own thing. The FDA has some standards that are not uniformly enforced. They are center specific. CDER and CBER are the two centers that are most closely linked. Require CDISC heading towards STDTM, ADaM and other data standards. CDRH has a more heterogeneous sponsor group and even gets some submissions in Excel.\nCVM is in between. Other centers like CPT don’t much deal with clinical trials. Paul’s presentation (from last time) focused on CDER and CBER and the portals and gateways that have been set up there. Even within the his center the Office of Biostatistics does not control the standards FDA submissions gateway uses.\nThere are two different types of standards: there are the standards of CDISC and PHUSE and then there are the standards of “What does one have to do to actually submit through the electronics gateway”.\nEric Nantz asks if the group that is handling the gateway is also in CDER and CBER. PS replied that it is, but in a different office. (At 11:21 PS elaborates on which groups are involved.) The actual gateway is under the Office of Business Informatics which is in the Office of Strategic Programs. It is a Balkanized setup. Primary tool for clinicians in the Office of New Drugs is JMP clinical, script in Python, some code in SAS and R.\nAnything with inferential statistics falls to the Office of Biostatistics. Safety issues are mostly done elsewhere by clinicians.\nProject PORTES has a provision for a submissions portal and also includes turning XPT data sets into S or R data sets. PS recommends getting Ethan Chen involved, but in short term writing program that modifies scripts (e.g. from .lower case to .Upper case) would be faster approach.\nEN and PS note that the discussions last time (see the presentation by Yilong Zhang) made it clear that industry is already working on this approach and suggest that it may be worth pursuing.\nJR (22:29) suggested that we may want to pursue the idea of setting up a stable R environment. YZ says Merck is working on a package to assemble functions into a txt file, and stated that once they have a stable version they would be willing to discuss making it open source.\nJR suggests that going for a stable R environment would pull together several threads of work in progress, and asked if setting up a pilot server with an R environment configured similarly to an environment typically used for submissions would be helpful. PS said that he thought so and referenced (26:30) a project he and EN did a couple of years ago to stand up a stable snapshot.\nYZ argues for making a purely open source setup. YZ and EN suggest (48:30) that we could setup a repo with software to CDISC tables and synthetic data for a hypothetical submission and we could collaborate and show how it could scale to do a real submission.\nPS noted that a project he and Doug Kelkhoff worked on to use Docker had issues with mixing environment like Windows and Linux. PS noted that he is constrained to use a particular version of Windows 10.\nPS likes the idea of having a common repo that includes a class of standard packages. Mike Stackhouse notes that the problem is to have the right structure, packages and package management. MS notes that there are several package management solutions available\nJames Black asks Paul (33:00) how identical solutions have to be. There was some discussion about this. PS notes opinions vary between 100% identical and having results close enough so as not to change the decision. (e.g. p = 0.019 and p = 0.19 are clearly different, but there is a lot of gray area.)\nEN notes it is possible to lock down what goes into a container that would minimize risk even OS differences, but states that getting things stable at the R package level is the bigger issue. (There seemed to be general agreement about this.) DK says locking downing the R environment using packrat or rn would give us a foothold. If this is successful we could reproduce the same environment in a container.\nDK noted that many of difficulties he and PS had during previous FDA project had to do with mounting a file system and how data is accessed within the FDA. Suggests bundling packages with base environment.\nMS asked if part of project would be to show that the pilot gives same results in Windows and Linux. PS indicates that it would.\nJR notes that there is a consensus for a pilot, and states that even if pilot did not address everything it would be a good start, and asks those present to uses the repo to suggest ideas and contribute relevant documents.\nAction Items\nJR takes action items to reach out to:\nPHUSE\nWendy Martinez\nToma Drogen (ORA deals with field inspectors)\nNext meeting\nAll agree on 9AM Pacific Time February 5th.\nVideo Recording\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here The passcode is oM5YqkM\nNote from Doug Kelkhoff\nIn a private communication after the meeting Doug Kelkhoff contributed the following:\nAt today’s meeting, Paul mentioned a pilot that he and I worked on to share docker containers. It would be great if I could share that code with you all. I reached out to the lead from the PHUSE working group to see if we can get that code uploaded somewhere where I can share it.\nA brief summary of what was done:\nDelivery of a docker-compose build script, chosen for transparency and to adhere to plain-text restrictions of delivery content. It consisted of:\nbase image based on rocker shiny+tidyverse image\na small cohort of packages to install\na mock analysis and companion shiny app\ndata access (which ended up being the problematic piece of the puzzle)\n\nWe encountered a few data access woes:\nwe first attempted to mount a data directory within the eCTD, which prompted for escalated administrator privileges on windows machines - not an acceptable solution\nthe second attempt was to build the data into the container image, which we were unfortunately not able to fully test before Paul had to move on to other priorities.\n\nOverall, I still have confidence that this method could work, but, as Paul mentioned, the “it works on my machine” method of trying to debug across platforms and administrated systems is both frustrating and time intensive. Remotely teasing apart docker-related issues from system administration restrictions without a clear picture of the systems constraints was quite a challenge.\n\n\n\n",

Paul Schuette agreed with this. He noted that the experiment he did with Eric Nantz two years ago (discussed in a previous meeting) was the closest he has come so far.\nNext followed a discussion about the FDA computing environment, a discussion thread that developed over the course of the meeting. Some key points are:\nFDA reviewers and researchers work primarily on desktop machines that mostly run Windows 10.\nThere are two classes of desktop computers 1) regulatory computers and 2) scientific computers.\nThe scientific computers are not as rigorously controlled as the scientific computers.\nPaul has installed Ubuntu on a few of the scientific computers\nDesktop computers run SAS version 9.4, but the build may differ\nA perceived advantage of SAS is that it generally runs older software\nThere is a pilot project going on at the FDA to run SAS on a server, which would ensure a common build.\nWhen asked: If the FDA decided to move to Linux, how long would it take to convert all of the desktops from Windows to Linux, Paul speculated that it would take a minimum of two years. The implication is that Windows is not going away anytime soon.\nWhen asked about the installation of R packages, Paul indicated that installation was not a problem.\nObtaining R packages is more of an issue. In theory, the FDA could use MRAN or some other repository which enables downloading specific versions of packages.\nThe discussion turned to considering section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide:\n\nYilong Zhang stated that his company has focused on the sentence: “The Specific Software utilized should be specified in the ADRG.” Mike Stackhouse explained that the PHUSE working group is is leading is also focused on interpreting this sentence.\nPaul noted that companies are obligated to use the SAS export file format, but are not obligated to use SAS. Bella Feng noted that a recent FDA oncology pilot explicitly specifies SAS.\nPaul noted that many FDA analyses are hybrid using both SAS and R. The group acknowledge that all R submissions were the ultimate goal, we should be planning to work with mixed submissions for some time.\nMike Stackhouse stated that, although there are many corner cases, we should focus on building a reference platform along the lines of least resistance and go for what is easily achievable. The group generally agreed with this.\nTowards the end of the meeting Paul mentioned that although the that section 4.1.2.10 specifies that programs should be submitted as text files, it does not mean that .txt extensions must be used. This surprised everyone. When asked if the FDA document could be revised to make this more clear, Paul stated that it was possible. He said that the document is generally revised once or twice a year, the most recent revision is dated Nov 20, 2020.\nAction Item: Paul stated that if the group wanted to suggest the wording to revise the document, he would submit it to the responsible FDA committee. He noted that to make the change it would need to be approved by the committee and go through the normal approval process.\nJoseph Rickert asked the group to use the repo to submit their suggested changes to the wording about using text, and reminded everyone that the next meeting was set for Friday, March 5, 2021.\nJoseph Rickert, Mike Stackhouse and Sascha Ahrweiler agreed to meet before the next Submissions group meeting to try and map out the various PHUSE, PSI and R Consortium working groups that are doing similar or complementary work.\nThe link to the video of the meeting is: https://zoom.us/rec/share/gFQancacysPFHm0Czrw3sAYOCrt35BgTbcodBdY2LGld4fkykDypkL99PX5o0i-c.JRCWwmZfO9Ui8G6f\nPasscode: +GKR9&i6\n\n\n\n",

Detailed information on the R Validation Hub project which is also organized as an R Consortium working group can be found here.\nNext, Nan Xiao of Merck gave an overview and demo of the R package pkglite which is expected to be up on CRAN soon.\nThe specific aims of the package are:\nAim 1: To provide a tool for packing and restoring R packages as plaintext assets that are easy to store, transfer, and review.\nAim 2: To provide a grammar for specifying the file packing scope that is functional, precise, and extendable.\nAim 3: To provide a standard for exchanging the packed asset that is unambiguous, human-friendly, and machine-readable.\nNan’s presentation can be found in the Document’s section of the R Consortium/submissions-wg GitHub repository.\nYilong stated that he hoped that our working group could collaborate on a pilot submission to the FDA. He prepared the following outline to be included in these minutes.\nGoal: prepare a open source dummy submission and submit to eCTD portal\nThe information below is to track potential high level action items. Individual issues can be created to track the progress later.\nData source: CDISC pilot submission\nR program for table listing and figure (TLFs): program\nGeneral action items:\nMake sure this use case is following CDISC terms of use\nIdentify TLFs in-scope for submission\nAction items for dummy submission package preparation:\nIdentify point of contact to initiate dummy submission request\nPrepare analysis results metadata\nPrepare step-by-step instruction to re-run analysis based on code in program folder and put in ADRG: link\nWrap-up submission package\nThose present all seemed to be enthusiastic about cooperating on the generating a dummy submission.\nNext, followed a lengthy discussion on the required process. Mike Stackhouse suggested that we work with PHUSE to suggest people who may be knowledgeable about past CDISC submissions. Paul Schuette recommended Zak Skrivanek.\nYilong Zhang mentioned that Merck intends to use this package as part of a pilot oncology submission in the near future. Bella mentioned that the FDA Oncology group had specified SAS.\nNing Leng of mentioned that Roche is preparing a rare disease submission for 2022.\nJoe Rickert asked the group: assuming the pkglite dummy submission is successful, how far the this would advance us towards the ultimate goal of an all R submission.\nWhile everyone was very excited about the pkglite all agreed with Doug Kelkhoff’s sober assessment that the industry would ultimately want a more “R idiomatic” solution that took advantage of R naming conventions and did not introduce special requirements for R package maintenance.\nMike Stackhouse noted that a successful pkglite submission would break down a significant barrier to R submissions, but that there were other hurdles. Nevertheless, he asserted that it would be a significant advance to be able to say here is “how” you can do an R submission.\nIt the few minutes that remained, Joe Rickert brought the groups attention to the copy of the word document containing the text of section 4.1.2.10 of the FDA document pertaining to software and asked everyone mark up the document to suggest ideal wording from the industry’s point of view.\nThe group agreed to met next on Friday April 1, at 9AM Pacific time.\nThe zoom recording of this meeting is available here (Passcode: d9N%+JWY).\n\n\n\n",

Time stamps in the Minutes refer to the video.\nMinutes\nJoseph Rickert opened the meeting at 9AM Pacific Time and told the group that Mike Stackhouse has revised the document for a pilot submission which is in the document folder of the GitHub repo. He asked Mike to give an overview.\n1:10 Mike’s Overview: The Submissions Working Group should make the opportunity to test out the pkglite package and try to get a pilot submission through the eCTD gateway. The objective would be to determine if an FDA reviewer would be able to receive and consume the content. This effort would be a discovery process exposing unanticipated problems in getting an R submission through the gateway and help to identify difficulties an FDA consumer would have in replicating the outputs of the pilot.\nMike stated that having a concrete example of pushing an R submission through the gateway would be “momentous”.\n6:37 Joe asks Paul Schuette if he agrees with Mike’s assessment of the benefits of the pilot. Paul affirms that it would be helpful and suggest using a simulated data set.\n7:55 Joe asks Paul if special preparation would have to happen on the receiving side. Paul replies that it would depend on the processes and procedures of gateway, and notes that in the past the authorities have asked for submissions by DVD and mail (This came up last year with respect to submitting University COVID tests.)\n11:03 Paul recommends putting in a formal request to involve additional agency reviewers. Mike suggests that submitting through Phuse would have some advantages since Phuse has a structured relationship with the FDA.\n12:53 Based on previous experience, Paul states that his is not certain about the efficacy of the Phuse relationship, but that he does not have serious objections\n15:06 Paul raises the possibility that the R Consortium could sponsor the pilot. Doug Kelkhoff, Yilong Zhang and others endorse this idea.\nAdrian Waddell asks how difficult is it to make a submission? Paul replies that he is not sure, but adds that to his knowledge at least one foundation has made a submission in the past. He advises we would have to reach out to group that manages gateway and EDR, and remarks that the R Consortium may have resource issues that pharma company does not have.\n17:37 Adrian alternative:\nSplit out the data and analysis code which need to be secure and go through gateway process.\nPut the code that does not involve patient level data on a public Github repository and devise a secure way to give the agency access.\n19:35 Paul describes a similar process he and Eric went through with a Lilly pilot where Paul had access to a Lilly Github site for 8 hours. This was a process that agency was able to handle with Eric’s help, but it was a one-off effort as part of CID pilot and not a typical submission. He speculates that the process would probably not be allowed as part of standard submission package.\n26:09 Mike brings the conversation back to logistics of getting a submission number to get the pilot process started.\n27:24 Joe asks if it is possible for more than one company to make joint submission and Doug clarifies this to mean have multiple companies co-sponsor a submission. He that the word “Sponsor” has a technical meaning to the FDA and that the system is set up for sponsors to be a company. The group agrees that the ideal would be to have R Consortium be the surrogate sponsor of the pilot.\n28:48 Paul suggests that we assess the possibility of having the R Consortium sponsor by reaching out to Ethan Chen who heads up the Division of Data Management Services and Solutions. Doug suggests that we invite Ethan, or someone designated by him to our next meeting.\nPaul notes that the invitation should be a formal process and suggests that as the representative of the R Consortium Joe write to Ethan to ask his group to participate in the process of planning for a pilot submission. Paul suggests that the letter could reference him and that the content of the letter emphasize that our group is part of an industry effort to help enhance and modernize submission tools. We are independent of, but in line with the recent Transcelerate MSA framework and the work being done by the R Validation Hub. Both of these efforts provide some justification as to why companies and consortia are interested the submissions process.\n34:37 Joe agrees write the email letter. Doug, Eric and other agree to help with drafting it.\n40:40 a discussion about whether approvals need to be obtained from the individual pharmaceutical companies\nAdrian points out that we would want to be able to try multiple approaches, and Paul indicates that an advantage of having the R Consortium sponsor would be to have multiple updates on the same submission number. It can sometimes take some companies multiple efforts to get something through the gateway\n46:53 Adrian asks when we make a solution how does the analysis code access the data? Paul replies that the standard is to have an M5 folder to hold CDISC tabular data and analysis data - code can be in separate folder or along with analysis data sets.\n51:00 Adrian describes the main goal to give health authorities something that they can easily use themselves.\n51:30 states the measure of success : Deliver something like like the CDISC package through eTCD and have and FDA reviewer recreate and install packages and reproduce the results\n54:41 Doug advises that the letter be general with no technical detail stating the R Consortium’s interest in being a sponsor and asking for agency participation.\nAction item Joe to draft letter and place it in the documents folder of the submissions repo by Tuesday of next week. The team will review and comment.\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here Passcode: Gb#E@4$S\n\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the group would like to have the R Consortium act as the sponsor of the pilot submission, and is looking for guidance to determine if this is possible.\n6:31 Ethan Chen expressed a desire to support the R Consortium initiative and mentioned that R is currently included as a supported file eCTD file format. See Specifications for File format Types Using eCTD Specifications.\n15:00 1. Test the exchange mechanism through the gateway and routing to the specific in the review division 2. Once received, can they be open and reviewed\nEthan stated that his team is involved mainly with the exchange method.\n15:30 In general, to initiate an a submission in a production environment an organization must open an ESG Accoount. This process includes requesting an account and writing a Non-Repudiation letter to the FDA. (See the AS2 Account Checklist). The FDA then will assign an application number.\n19:32 Doug Kelkhoff asks if it is possible for a non-profit such as the R Consortium could be a sponsor. Jiang Xu believes it is possible but will require further discussion.\n22:40 Adrian Waddell describes the interplay of the exchange and review processes.\n23:00 Ethan Chen outlines two major concerns:\nSecurity (Executable files not accepted)\nTo meet the error records management requirement the FDA must be able to open any submitted file for the entire retention period which could be up to 30 years.\n26:00 Joe ask Ethan if there is someone in particular who could help setting up the ESG account. Ethan replies that Heather and Jiang could help and also help to determine if the R Consortium could be a sponsor.\n26:55 Heather Crandall recommends becoming familiar with the requirements on the ESG Webpage.\n28:00 Doug Kelkhoff initiates a discussion of the challenges that the working group is hoping to address.\nThe ask right now is for the working group to understand what steps we must undertake and who would be our FDA contact is we get stuck.\n30:15 Jiang Xu states that the FDA would want to know exactly what things we think the FDA would need to test and notes that different FDA offices and centers would need to be involved.\n34:00 Yilong Zhang points out that a goal of the working group is to test how internally R packages could be transmitted to the FDA as part of a submission.\n35:25 Doug Kelkhoff describes challenges including file extensions and case sensitivity\n36:55 Adrian Weddell notes that if the working group is able to successfully make a pilot submission and put it out in the open it would provide a guide for other companies to follow. He also raised the issue of probing the security issues around the way R packages often require dependent packages to be installed.\n40:10 Bell Feng compares an R script to a SAS macro and asks for clarification about how we are using packages. Doug Kelkhoff clarifies that the issue is about the using R best practices and being able to install packages required to perform and analysis and not just submit R scripts.\n50:00 Joe asks if there are any other FDA offices or groups that the working group should contact. Jiang and Heather do not think any other contacts are necessary to contact at this time. Jiang indicates that they will discuss this within the FDA.\nThe group agreed to meet next on Wednesday June 30, 2021.\nThe video of the meeting is available here Passcode: V@.?eq85\nAction Items for the Working Group\nGenerate a list of potential issues and items that we think the FDA will want to evaluate.\nBecome familiar with process and requirements for opening an ESG account as described on the Electronic Submissions Gateway site.\n\n\n\n",

Joseph Rickert opened the meeting and suggested that the group pick up where we left off last time and discuss the feasibility of having the R Consortium sponsor the pilot trial. The group briefly considered whether it would be easier for a pharma company to sponsor the submission. However after a brief discussion, those presently decided that it would be far better for the R Consortium to be the sponsor, because it would make it clear that this is an industry effort and that all work would be carried out in the open.\nThere was consensus that Director Chen and his Office at the FDA were generally supportive of the effort and that there did not appear to be regulatory or other impediments with the RC being the sponsor. There is some uncertainty as to whether there would be a fee associated with the submission and how much that fee might be.\nThere was a discussion about what should be included in first pilot submission and what the next steps should be. The members present concluded that the first pilot submission should be simple, but not trivial, that it should be something more than a “Hello World”. All agreed that it would be optimal to plan the content of sequential submissions in order to make continuous progress with small steps in the beginning and perhaps more ambitious efforts as the project progressed.\nThere was also some discussion about the form of the submission and the documentation that should be included. Paul Schuette suggested that the submission package should include a cover letter to set expectations. The letter should describe the submission at a high level, and describe how the objectives will be accomplished. The documentation for the submission package should include: * A cover letter * A detailed description of the submission package * Some suggestions how the FDA reviewers could evaluate the submission * A description of the kind of feedback that would be helpful * Perhaps a written response from the FDA describing their evaluation\nAction Items\nThe members present agreed to divide the work as follows.\nSponsor Application\nJoe Rickert, Eli Miller and Doug Kelkhoff will look into identifying all of the steps in the application process and begin the process..\nPrepare the Submission Package\nYilong Zhang volunteered to take the lead in designing and assembling the submission package. Those participating in this task will use the GitHub issues to communicate tasks. Yilong also offered to look into setting up a GitHub project.\nFDA Participation\nPaul agreed to see if his group could be the primary FDA contact.\nVideo Recording\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here Passcode: ax2L&E71\nNext Meeting\nThe next meeting will be held on Friday, August 6, 2021 at 9AM Pacific Time.\n\n\n\n",

He described how he received an email from the FDA about canceling the ticket for the ESG and asked if this was a problem. The email which was sent by the ESG help desk on 7/22/2021 read:\nTicket 275030: [EXTERNAL] Re: New WebTrader Test Account Registration Your ticket (275030) has been closed.

She began with an overview of the documents in the new repository https://github.com/RConsortium/r-submission-site\nSome highlights of Ning’s overview:\nAll work will be done in the open with the R Consortium being the sponsor for the pilot submissions.\nThe submission package will not favor any one company. R packages used should be either open source or packages developed by multiple companies.\nThree different pilots are planned, each one being more ambitious than the previous.\nNing and Yilong estimate three months to do the submission\nWe need to set up the account with the FDA\nThere is a project board summarizing the tasks.\nAn R Markdown document describes the project\nIt is envisioned that the r-submission-site will be public facing and user friendly\nThere was a discussion about how much documentation needs to go into the phase 1 Pilot. Yilong noted that the a CSR and other materials have already been submitted in the CDISC pilot and since we are only submitting R versions of some of the SAS tables in the CDISC pilot we can refer to those.\nSome of the CDISC documents have already been placed into the Pilot 1 package.\nAdrian asked for clarification about the differences between Pilot 1 and Pilot 2. Ning said they were thinking to include and analysis package in Pilot 2. Adrian also suggested including reviewer aids in Pilots 2 and 3, including Shiny apps and the like.\nThe conversation shifted to what was required to get the FDA account set up. Paul suggested consulting with Ethan’s group. Ning took the Action Item to ask the Roche submissions team what needs to be done.\nAdrian suggested that we augment the project board to reflect To Do, In Progress, Done\nJoe granted maintainer privileges for the submissions-wg repo to the following members of the WG: Eli Miller, Yilong Zhang, Eric Nantz, Ning Leng, Adrian Waddell.\nAdrian then set up the Kanban board in real time. Ning and Yilong will populate the Kanban with the tasks they defined.\nWe are not able to use the credentials above to access the FDA account. Sorting this out was assigned as a task on the Kanban board.\nThe second half of the video of the meeting includes Adrian showing how to use the projects board.\nThe zoom recording is available.

He mentioned that Eli Miller reported although we do have credentials to use the FDA submissions gateway, these have timed out. Reactivating gateway access requires that I send an email to the FDA help desk. Eli recommends that I wait until we are nearly ready to submit before doing this.\nNext, Ning Leng presented the recently up dated slides describing the R Submissions Pilot. Ning will upload this slides to the repo.\n\nThe slides include the working time line for the series of pilot submissions:\nPilot1: common analysis (Q4 2021 - hopefully Oct/early Nov)\nPilot2: advanced analysis (Q2 2022)\nPilot3: alternative formatting for package submission (TBD)\nTimeline for near term work: * 9/30/2021 complete the draft code and documents along with the internal review by the execution team * 10/1 - 10/15 2021: review by the WG * Late Oct: actual submission after adjudication\nThe two major asks from the execution team: 1. WG members: provide feedback during the review in Oct 2. FDA: Identify potential reviewers\nNext, there was a discussion about the content of the submission package and terminology. (9:48 in the video). This discussion also contains and explanation of the strategy for encoding the R package as a text file to get it through the gateway and how we will handle package dependencies.\nIn our documentation and communication we must be careful to distinguish between the Submission package for the pilot and the R Package containing R code that will be a part of the Submission package. Ning and the team will come up with names for both of these maybe: Pilot1 Submission for the Pilot1 Submission Package. The format for the Submission package will match the folder structure for the submission portal.\nJoe then noted that we now have two R Consortium GitHub repositories associated with the working group. 1. https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg is the primary repository for the working group. The Kanban board project on this repo is what we use to manage the submissions project. 2. The repo https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1 is the code development repo for the Pilot1 submission.\nNext, Adrian walked through the status of the tasks on the Kanban Board. (20:19 on the video).\nJoe will write a blog post to describing what the submission team is doing with the intention of getting more pharma companies before the submission. Mike Stackhouse will help with getting it through the PHUSE marketing channels.\nThere was a discussion (43:30) about finding an FDA reviewer for the pilot. Paul Schuette took the action item to find someone who will probably be a statistician but not a formally designated FDA reviewer. It was suggested that the criteria for reviewing the pilot submission and the criteria for the success of the project be included in the cover letter.\nJoe asked what would be required to communicate the success of the pilot. Paul stated that formal approval from the FDA would be required for a press release and that the project should be included as part of the FDA’s Technology Modernization Action Plan (T-MAP) and the Data Modernization Action Plan (D-MAP). It would be best to investigate this after we have the proof of concept of the Pilot1.\nIn response to the question if eventually we would want to have the pilot reviewed by a formal FDA reviewer, Paul noted that they have several R competent FDA reviewers especially among the new graduates. However, if a reviewer need help they would most likely reach out to the Paul’s group.\nWhen asked whether would expect reviewers to compare SAS and R results, Paul suggested that we should focus on a limited definition of validation for our first submission.\nWhen asked whether we should have a future goal of having FDA reviewers to take the code in the submission package and and do further analyses, Paul stated that they can do that now. More interesting would be to have the submission package include a Shiny application for interactive data visualization.\nAt the top of the hour Joe asked whether anyone on the call was involved with preparing a presentation about the Submissions project for the upcoming R / Pharma conference. Paul responded that he may be. The FDA is still working out the details of a keynote talk in which Paul will participate. The group extended an offer to help provide material.\nThe group agreed to extend the meeting beyond the hour to review Ning’s proposal for language to be added to section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide. (1:03 on video) Ning suggested adding:\n\nSubmission of programs with their native file extensions are acceptable, as long as binary file formats and pre-compilde code are not delivered.\n\nPaul stated that .bat files need to be excluded. This launched a discussion of how to generalize this. Paul suggested executable but Doug noted that .bat files are executable on Windows but not on other operating systems. Doug took the action to consider how to describe the issue in a more general fashion. Paul expressed the essential idea as “We can open it, we can look at it, but we don’t want it to run.”\nIn the final minutes, Adrian asked about not having to submit .txt files. Paul suggested that this would require changes within the Agency, and would probably require getting the suggested changes to 4.1.2.10 passed.\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Friday, October 1, 2020. At that meeting we will decide whether we need a special session to provide material for Paul’s presentation.\nThe zoom video recording is available. Passcode: #Sk!6tXL\n\n\n\n",

Paul also noted that although it might be possible it is not likely that the FDA could accomplish the task requested before the R/Pharma conference which begins on November 2. Those present agreed that it is not necessary to tie the completion of the FDA activities to R/Pharma.\nAfter Ning’s presentation there was a discussion about suggestions for amending the language to section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data Technical Performance Guide. Doug Kelkhoff noted that in internal discussions within Genentech the idea was floated that, as written the document may already allow passing R code in tar balls through the FDA gateway. If this were indeed true it would greatly simply R submissions since tar balls are a common method of delivering R code. Jian Xu of the FDA suggest that the way to get an answer to this question is to submit the question to the email address provided on the FDA eCTD webpage: Submit an eCTD or Standardized Data Sample to the FDA. Joe and Doug took the action item to write up the question and submit it.\nThe group then considered a proposal by Adrian to organize the several GitHub repositories and activities of the Submissions WG using the Teams features of GitHub. The group agreed that this would be a good idea but suggested waiting until after Pilot1 is completed. Adrian will set up a meeting with Joe and Ning to setup the structure.\nThe video of today’s 10-1-21 meeting is available here passcode: &1b4VEkR\nThe next meeting of the WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday November 5, 2021.\n\n\n\n",
