Michael\nStackhouse and Paul Schuette suggest linking up with PHUSE. JR asks for\na recommendation from PHUSE, MS offers to investigate.\nJR asked PS if he could elaborate on requirements from various\ngovernment agencies. Paul recommends contacting Wendy Martinez of BLS,\nand leader of the Inter-Agency R Users Group.\nPS also notes that declining budgets in various government agencies\nare forcing declining budgets and that consequently there is a renewed\ninterest in open source. There is particular interest in establishing a\nstable R environment and the whole panoply of tools required.\nJR noted that although other federal agencies are not directly\ninvolved in setting requirements for R submissions they must have some\nsay in setting general requirements and technology standards and asked\nPS if he could elaborate on the hierarchy of federal agencies involved.\nPS stated that the government has a federated model. Groups tend to do\ntheir own thing. The FDA has some standards that are not uniformly\nenforced. They are center specific. CDER\nand CBER\nare the two centers that are most closely linked. Require CDISC heading\ntowards STDTM, ADaM and other data standards. CDRH\nhas a more heterogeneous sponsor group and even gets some submissions in\nExcel.\nCVM\nis in between. Other centers like CPT\ndon’t much deal with clinical trials. Paul’s presentation (from last\ntime) focused on CDER and CBER and the portals and gateways that have\nbeen set up there. Even within the his center the Office of\nBiostatistics does not control the standards FDA submissions gateway\nuses.\nThere are two different types of standards: there are the standards\nof CDISC and PHUSE and then there are the standards of “What does one\nhave to do to actually submit through the electronics gateway”.\nEric Nantz asks if the group that is handling the gateway is also in\nCDER and CBER. PS replied that it is, but in a different office. (At\n11:21 PS elaborates on which groups are involved.) The actual gateway is\nunder the Office of Business Informatics which is in the Office of\nStrategic Programs. It is a Balkanized setup. Primary tool for\nclinicians in the Office of New Drugs is JMP clinical, script in Python,\nsome code in SAS and R.\nAnything with inferential statistics falls to the Office\nof Biostatistics. Safety issues are mostly done elsewhere by\nclinicians.\nProject PORTES\nhas a provision for a submissions portal and also includes turning XPT\ndata sets into S or R data sets. PS recommends getting Ethan\nChen involved, but in short term writing program that modifies\nscripts (e.g. from .lower case to .Upper case) would be faster\napproach.\nEN and PS note that the discussions last time (see the presentation\nby Yilong Zhang) made it clear that industry is already working on this\napproach and suggest that it may be worth pursuing.\nJR (22:29) suggested that we may want to pursue the idea of setting\nup a stable R environment. YZ says Merck is working on a package to\nassemble functions into a txt file, and stated that once they have a\nstable version they would be willing to discuss making it open\nsource.\nJR suggests that going for a stable R environment would pull together\nseveral threads of work in progress, and asked if setting up a pilot\nserver with an R environment configured similarly to an environment\ntypically used for submissions would be helpful. PS said that he thought\nso and referenced (26:30) a project he and EN did a couple of years ago\nto stand up a stable snapshot.\nYZ argues for making a purely open source setup. YZ and EN suggest\n(48:30) that we could setup a repo with software to CDISC tables and\nsynthetic data for a hypothetical submission and we could collaborate\nand show how it could scale to do a real submission.\nPS noted that a project he and Doug Kelkhoff worked on to use Docker\nhad issues with mixing environment like Windows and Linux. PS noted that\nhe is constrained to use a particular version of Windows 10.\nPS likes the idea of having a common repo that includes a class of\nstandard packages. Mike Stackhouse notes that the problem is to have the\nright structure, packages and package management. MS notes that there\nare several package management solutions available\nJames Black asks Paul (33:00) how identical solutions have to be.\nThere was some discussion about this. PS notes opinions vary between\n100% identical and having results close enough so as not to change the\ndecision. (e.g. p = 0.019 and p = 0.19 are clearly different, but there\nis a lot of gray area.)\nEN notes it is possible to lock down what goes into a container that\nwould minimize risk even OS differences, but states that getting things\nstable at the R package level is the bigger issue. (There seemed to be\ngeneral agreement about this.) DK says locking downing the R environment\nusing packrat or rn would give us a foothold. If this is successful we\ncould reproduce the same environment in a container.\nDK noted that many of difficulties he and PS had during previous FDA\nproject had to do with mounting a file system and how data is accessed\nwithin the FDA. Suggests bundling packages with base environment.\nMS asked if part of project would be to show that the pilot gives\nsame results in Windows and Linux. PS indicates that it would.\nJR notes that there is a consensus for a pilot, and states that even\nif pilot did not address everything it would be a good start, and asks\nthose present to uses the repo to suggest ideas and contribute relevant\ndocuments.\nAction Items\nJR takes action items to reach out to:\nPHUSE\nWendy Martinez\nToma Drogen (ORA deals with field inspectors)\nNext meeting\nAll agree on 9AM Pacific Time February 5th.\nVideo Recording\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here\nThe passcode is oM5YqkM\nNote from Doug Kelkhoff\nIn a private communication after the meeting Doug Kelkhoff\ncontributed the following:\nAt today’s meeting, Paul mentioned a pilot that he and I worked on to\nshare docker containers. It would be great if I could share that code\nwith you all. I reached out to the lead from the PHUSE working group to\nsee if we can get that code uploaded somewhere where I can share it.\nA brief summary of what was done:\nDelivery of a docker-compose build script, chosen for transparency\nand to adhere to plain-text restrictions of delivery content. It\nconsisted of:\nbase image based on rocker shiny+tidyverse image\na small cohort of packages to install\na mock analysis and companion shiny app\ndata access (which ended up being the problematic piece of the\npuzzle)\n\nWe encountered a few data access woes:\nwe first attempted to mount a data directory within the eCTD, which\nprompted for escalated administrator privileges on windows machines -\nnot an acceptable solution\nthe second attempt was to build the data into the container image,\nwhich we were unfortunately not able to fully test before Paul had to\nmove on to other priorities.\n\nOverall, I still have confidence that this method could work, but, as\nPaul mentioned, the “it works on my machine” method of trying to debug\nacross platforms and administrated systems is both frustrating and time\nintensive. Remotely teasing apart docker-related issues from system\nadministration restrictions without a clear picture of the systems\nconstraints was quite a challenge.\n\n\n\n",

Paul Schuette agreed with\nthis. He noted that the experiment he did with Eric Nantz two years ago\n(discussed in a previous meeting) was the closest he has come so\nfar.\nNext followed a discussion about the FDA computing environment, a\ndiscussion thread that developed over the course of the meeting. Some\nkey points are:\nFDA reviewers and researchers work primarily on desktop machines\nthat mostly run Windows 10.\nThere are two classes of desktop computers 1) regulatory computers\nand 2) scientific computers.\nThe scientific computers are not as rigorously controlled as the\nscientific computers.\nPaul has installed Ubuntu on a few of the scientific computers\nDesktop computers run SAS version 9.4, but the build may differ\nA perceived advantage of SAS is that it generally runs older\nsoftware\nThere is a pilot project going on at the FDA to run SAS on a server,\nwhich would ensure a common build.\nWhen asked: If the FDA decided to move to Linux, how long would it\ntake to convert all of the desktops from Windows to Linux, Paul\nspeculated that it would take a minimum of two years. The implication is\nthat Windows is not going away anytime soon.\nWhen asked about the installation of R packages, Paul indicated that\ninstallation was not a problem.\nObtaining R packages is more of an issue. In theory, the FDA could\nuse MRAN or some other repository which enables downloading specific\nversions of packages.\nThe discussion turned to considering section 4.1.2.10 of the Study\nData Technical Performance Guide:\n\nYilong Zhang stated that his company has focused on the sentence:\n“The Specific Software utilized should be specified in the ADRG.” Mike\nStackhouse explained that the PHUSE working group is is leading is also\nfocused on interpreting this sentence.\nPaul noted that companies are obligated to use the SAS export file\nformat, but are not obligated to use SAS. Bella Feng noted that a recent\nFDA oncology pilot explicitly specifies SAS.\nPaul noted that many FDA analyses are hybrid using both SAS and R.\nThe group acknowledge that all R submissions were the ultimate goal, we\nshould be planning to work with mixed submissions for some time.\nMike Stackhouse stated that, although there are many corner cases, we\nshould focus on building a reference platform along the lines of least\nresistance and go for what is easily achievable. The group generally\nagreed with this.\nTowards the end of the meeting Paul mentioned that although the that\nsection 4.1.2.10 specifies that programs should be submitted as text\nfiles, it does not mean that .txt extensions must be used. This\nsurprised everyone. When asked if the FDA document could be revised to\nmake this more clear, Paul stated that it was possible. He said that the\ndocument is generally revised once or twice a year, the most recent\nrevision is dated Nov 20, 2020.\nAction Item: Paul stated that if the group wanted to\nsuggest the wording to revise the document, he would submit it to the\nresponsible FDA committee. He noted that to make the change it would\nneed to be approved by the committee and go through the normal approval\nprocess.\nJoseph Rickert asked the group to use the repo to submit their\nsuggested changes to the wording about using text, and reminded everyone\nthat the next meeting was set for Friday, March 5, 2021.\nJoseph Rickert, Mike Stackhouse and Sascha Ahrweiler agreed to meet\nbefore the next Submissions group meeting to try and map out the various\nPHUSE, PSI and R Consortium working groups that are doing similar or\ncomplementary work.\nThe link to the video of the meeting is: https://zoom.us/rec/share/gFQancacysPFHm0Czrw3sAYOCrt35BgTbcodBdY2LGld4fkykDypkL99PX5o0i-c.JRCWwmZfO9Ui8G6f\nPasscode: +GKR9&i6\n\n\n\n",

Detailed\ninformation on the R Validation Hub project which is also organized as\nan R Consortium working group can be found here.\nNext, Nan Xiao of Merck gave an overview and demo of the R package\npkglite which is expected to be up on CRAN soon.\nThe specific aims of the package are:\nAim 1: To provide a tool for packing and restoring R packages as\nplaintext assets that are easy to store, transfer, and review.\nAim 2: To provide a grammar for specifying the file packing scope\nthat is functional, precise, and extendable.\nAim 3: To provide a standard for exchanging the packed asset that is\nunambiguous, human-friendly, and machine-readable.\nNan’s presentation can be found in the Document’s section of the R\nConsortium/submissions-wg GitHub repository.\nYilong stated that he hoped that our working group could collaborate\non a pilot submission to the FDA. He prepared the following outline to\nbe included in these minutes.\nGoal: prepare a open source dummy submission and submit to eCTD\nportal\nThe information below is to track potential high level action items.\nIndividual issues can be created to track the progress later.\nData source: CDISC\npilot submission\nR program for table listing and figure (TLFs): program\nGeneral action items:\nMake sure this use case is following CDISC terms of use\nIdentify TLFs in-scope for submission\nAction items for dummy submission package preparation:\nIdentify point of contact to initiate dummy submission request\nPrepare analysis results metadata\nPrepare step-by-step instruction to re-run analysis based on code in\nprogram folder and put in ADRG: link\nWrap-up submission package\nThose present all seemed to be enthusiastic about cooperating on the\ngenerating a dummy submission.\nNext, followed a lengthy discussion on the required process. Mike\nStackhouse suggested that we work with PHUSE to suggest people who may\nbe knowledgeable about past CDISC submissions. Paul Schuette recommended\nZak Skrivanek.\nYilong Zhang mentioned that Merck intends to use this package as part\nof a pilot oncology submission in the near future. Bella mentioned that\nthe FDA Oncology group had specified SAS.\nNing Leng of mentioned that Roche is preparing a rare disease\nsubmission for 2022.\nJoe Rickert asked the group: assuming the pkglite dummy\nsubmission is successful, how far the this would advance us towards the\nultimate goal of an all R submission.\nWhile everyone was very excited about the pkglite all\nagreed with Doug Kelkhoff’s sober assessment that the industry would\nultimately want a more “R idiomatic” solution that took advantage of R\nnaming conventions and did not introduce special requirements for R\npackage maintenance.\nMike Stackhouse noted that a successful pkglite\nsubmission would break down a significant barrier to R submissions, but\nthat there were other hurdles. Nevertheless, he asserted that it would\nbe a significant advance to be able to say here is “how” you can do an R\nsubmission.\nIt the few minutes that remained, Joe Rickert brought the groups\nattention to the copy of the word document containing the text of\nsection 4.1.2.10 of the FDA document pertaining to software and asked\neveryone mark up the document to suggest ideal wording from the\nindustry’s point of view.\nThe group agreed to met next on Friday April 1, at 9AM Pacific\ntime.\nThe zoom recording of this meeting is available here\n(Passcode: d9N%+JWY).\n\n\n\n",

Time stamps in the Minutes refer to the video.\nMinutes\nJoseph Rickert opened the meeting at 9AM Pacific Time and told the\ngroup that Mike Stackhouse has revised the document\nfor a pilot submission which is in the document folder of the GitHub\nrepo. He asked Mike to give an overview.\n1:10 Mike’s Overview: The Submissions Working Group\nshould make the opportunity to test out the pkglite package and try to\nget a pilot submission through the eCTD\ngateway. The objective would be to determine if an FDA reviewer would be\nable to receive and consume the content. This effort would be a\ndiscovery process exposing unanticipated problems in getting an R\nsubmission through the gateway and help to identify difficulties an FDA\nconsumer would have in replicating the outputs of the pilot.\nMike stated that having a concrete example of pushing an R submission\nthrough the gateway would be “momentous”.\n6:37 Joe asks Paul Schuette if he agrees with Mike’s\nassessment of the benefits of the pilot. Paul affirms that it would be\nhelpful and suggest using a simulated data set.\n7:55 Joe asks Paul if special preparation would have\nto happen on the receiving side. Paul replies that it would depend on\nthe processes and procedures of gateway, and notes that in the past the\nauthorities have asked for submissions by DVD and mail (This came up\nlast year with respect to submitting University COVID tests.)\n11:03 Paul recommends putting in a formal request to\ninvolve additional agency reviewers. Mike suggests that submitting\nthrough Phuse would have some advantages since Phuse has a structured\nrelationship with the FDA.\n12:53 Based on previous experience, Paul states that\nhis is not certain about the efficacy of the Phuse relationship, but\nthat he does not have serious objections\n15:06 Paul raises the possibility that the R\nConsortium could sponsor the pilot. Doug Kelkhoff, Yilong Zhang and\nothers endorse this idea.\nAdrian Waddell asks how difficult is it to make a submission? Paul\nreplies that he is not sure, but adds that to his knowledge at least one\nfoundation has made a submission in the past. He advises we would have\nto reach out to group that manages gateway and EDR, and remarks that the\nR Consortium may have resource issues that pharma company does not\nhave.\n17:37 Adrian alternative:\nSplit out the data and analysis code which need to be secure and go\nthrough gateway process.\nPut the code that does not involve patient level data on a public\nGithub repository and devise a secure way to give the agency\naccess.\n19:35 Paul describes a similar process he and Eric\nwent through with a Lilly pilot where Paul had access to a Lilly Github\nsite for 8 hours. This was a process that agency was able to handle with\nEric’s help, but it was a one-off effort as part of CID\npilot and not a typical submission. He speculates that the process\nwould probably not be allowed as part of standard submission\npackage.\n26:09 Mike brings the conversation back to logistics\nof getting a submission number to get the pilot process started.\n27:24 Joe asks if it is possible for more than one\ncompany to make joint submission and Doug clarifies this to mean have\nmultiple companies co-sponsor a submission. He that the word “Sponsor”\nhas a technical meaning to the FDA and that the system is set up for\nsponsors to be a company. The group agrees that the ideal would be to\nhave R Consortium be the surrogate sponsor of the pilot.\n28:48 Paul suggests that we assess the possibility\nof having the R Consortium sponsor by reaching out to Ethan Chen\nwho heads up the Division of Data Management Services and Solutions.\nDoug suggests that we invite Ethan, or someone designated by him to our\nnext meeting.\nPaul notes that the invitation should be a formal process and\nsuggests that as the representative of the R Consortium Joe write to\nEthan to ask his group to participate in the process of planning for a\npilot submission. Paul suggests that the letter could reference him and\nthat the content of the letter emphasize that our group is part of an\nindustry effort to help enhance and modernize submission tools. We are\nindependent of, but in line with the recent Transcelerate MSA\nframework and the work being done by the R Validation Hub. Both of\nthese efforts provide some justification as to why companies and\nconsortia are interested the submissions process.\n34:37 Joe agrees write the email letter. Doug, Eric\nand other agree to help with drafting it.\n40:40 a discussion about whether approvals need to\nbe obtained from the individual pharmaceutical companies\nAdrian points out that we would want to be able to try multiple\napproaches, and Paul indicates that an advantage of having the R\nConsortium sponsor would be to have multiple updates on the same\nsubmission number. It can sometimes take some companies multiple efforts\nto get something through the gateway\n46:53 Adrian asks when we make a solution how does\nthe analysis code access the data? Paul replies that the standard is to\nhave an M5 folder to hold CDISC tabular data and analysis data - code\ncan be in separate folder or along with analysis data sets.\n51:00 Adrian describes the main goal to give health\nauthorities something that they can easily use themselves.\n51:30 states the measure of success : Deliver\nsomething like like the CDISC package through eTCD and have and FDA\nreviewer recreate and install packages and reproduce the results\n54:41 Doug advises that the letter be general with\nno technical detail stating the R Consortium’s interest in being a\nsponsor and asking for agency participation.\nAction item Joe to draft letter and place it in the\ndocuments folder of the submissions repo by Tuesday of next week. The\nteam will review and comment.\nThe video recording of the meeting is available here\nPasscode: Gb#E@4$S\n\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the group would\nlike to have the R Consortium act as the sponsor of the pilot\nsubmission, and is looking for guidance to determine if this is\npossible.\n6:31 Ethan Chen expressed a desire to support the R\nConsortium initiative and mentioned that R is currently included as a\nsupported file eCTD file format. See Specifications for File\nformat Types Using eCTD Specifications.\n15:00 1. Test the exchange mechanism through the\ngateway and routing to the specific in the review division 2. Once\nreceived, can they be open and reviewed\nEthan stated that his team is involved mainly with the exchange\nmethod.\n15:30 In general, to initiate an a submission in a\nproduction environment an organization must open an ESG\nAccoount. This process includes requesting an account and writing a\nNon-Repudiation\nletter to the FDA. (See the AS2\nAccount Checklist). The FDA then will assign an application\nnumber.\n19:32 Doug Kelkhoff asks if it is possible for a\nnon-profit such as the R Consortium could be a sponsor. Jiang Xu\nbelieves it is possible but will require further discussion.\n22:40 Adrian Waddell describes the interplay of the\nexchange and review processes.\n23:00 Ethan Chen outlines two major concerns:\nSecurity (Executable files not accepted)\nTo meet the error records management requirement the FDA must be\nable to open any submitted file for the entire retention period which\ncould be up to 30 years.\n26:00 Joe ask Ethan if there is someone in\nparticular who could help setting up the ESG account. Ethan replies that\nHeather and Jiang could help and also help to determine if the R\nConsortium could be a sponsor.\n26:55 Heather Crandall recommends becoming familiar\nwith the requirements on the ESG\nWebpage.\n28:00 Doug Kelkhoff initiates a discussion of the\nchallenges that the working group is hoping to address.\nThe ask right now is for the working group to understand what steps\nwe must undertake and who would be our FDA contact is we get stuck.\n30:15 Jiang Xu states that the FDA would want to\nknow exactly what things we think the FDA would need to test and notes\nthat different FDA offices and centers would need to be involved.\n34:00 Yilong Zhang points out that a goal of the\nworking group is to test how internally R packages could be transmitted\nto the FDA as part of a submission.\n35:25 Doug Kelkhoff describes challenges including\nfile extensions and case sensitivity\n36:55 Adrian Weddell notes that if the working group\nis able to successfully make a pilot submission and put it out in the\nopen it would provide a guide for other companies to follow. He also\nraised the issue of probing the security issues around the way R\npackages often require dependent packages to be installed.\n40:10 Bell Feng compares an R script to a SAS macro\nand asks for clarification about how we are using packages. Doug\nKelkhoff clarifies that the issue is about the using R best practices\nand being able to install packages required to perform and analysis and\nnot just submit R scripts.\n50:00 Joe asks if there are any other FDA offices or\ngroups that the working group should contact. Jiang and Heather do not\nthink any other contacts are necessary to contact at this time. Jiang\nindicates that they will discuss this within the FDA.\nThe group agreed to meet next on Wednesday June 30, 2021.\nThe video of the meeting is available\nhere Passcode: V@.?eq85\nAction Items for the Working Group\nGenerate a list of potential issues and items that we think the FDA\nwill want to evaluate.\nBecome familiar with process and requirements for opening an ESG\naccount as described on the Electronic\nSubmissions Gateway site.\n\n\n\n",

Joseph Rickert opened the meeting and suggested that the group\npick up where we left off last time and discuss the feasibility of\nhaving the R Consortium sponsor the pilot trial. The group briefly\nconsidered whether it would be easier for a pharma company to sponsor\nthe submission. However after a brief discussion, those presently\ndecided that it would be far better for the R Consortium to be the\nsponsor, because it would make it clear that this is an industry effort\nand that all work would be carried out in the open.\nThere was consensus that Director Chen and his Office at the FDA were\ngenerally supportive of the effort and that there did not appear to be\nregulatory or other impediments with the RC being the sponsor. There is\nsome uncertainty as to whether there would be a fee associated with the\nsubmission and how much that fee might be.\nThere was a discussion about what should be included in first pilot\nsubmission and what the next steps should be. The members present\nconcluded that the first pilot submission should be simple, but not\ntrivial, that it should be something more than a “Hello World”. All\nagreed that it would be optimal to plan the content of sequential\nsubmissions in order to make continuous progress with small steps in the\nbeginning and perhaps more ambitious efforts as the project\nprogressed.\nThere was also some discussion about the form of the submission and\nthe documentation that should be included. Paul Schuette suggested that\nthe submission package should include a cover letter to set\nexpectations. The letter should describe the submission at a high level,\nand describe how the objectives will be accomplished. The documentation\nfor the submission package should include: * A cover letter * A detailed\ndescription of the submission package * Some suggestions how the FDA\nreviewers could evaluate the submission * A description of the kind of\nfeedback that would be helpful * Perhaps a written response from the FDA\ndescribing their evaluation\nAction Items\nThe members present agreed to divide the work as follows.\nSponsor Application\nJoe Rickert, Eli Miller and Doug Kelkhoff will look into identifying\nall of the steps in the application process and begin the process..\nPrepare the Submission\nPackage\nYilong Zhang volunteered to take the lead in designing and assembling\nthe submission package.

She began with an\noverview of the documents in the new repository https://github.com/RConsortium/r-submission-site\nSome highlights of Ning’s overview:\nAll work will be done in the open with the R Consortium being the\nsponsor for the pilot submissions.\nThe submission package will not favor any one company. R packages\nused should be either open source or packages developed by multiple\ncompanies.\nThree different pilots are planned, each one being more ambitious\nthan the previous.\nNing and Yilong estimate three months to do the submission\nWe need to set up the account with the FDA\nThere is a project\nboard summarizing the tasks.\nAn R\nMarkdown document describes the project\nIt is envisioned that the r-submission-site\nwill be public facing and user friendly\nThere was a discussion about how much documentation needs to go into\nthe phase 1 Pilot. Yilong noted that the a CSR and other materials have\nalready been submitted in the CDISC pilot and since we are only\nsubmitting R versions of some of the SAS tables in the CDISC pilot we\ncan refer to those.\nSome of the CDISC documents have already been placed into the Pilot\n1 package.\nAdrian asked for clarification about the differences between Pilot 1\nand Pilot 2. Ning said they were thinking to include and analysis\npackage in Pilot 2. Adrian also suggested including reviewer aids in\nPilots 2 and 3, including Shiny apps and the like.\nThe conversation shifted to what was required to get the FDA account\nset up. Paul suggested consulting with Ethan’s group. Ning took the\nAction Item to ask the Roche submissions team what\nneeds to be done.\nAdrian suggested that we augment the project board to reflect To\nDo, In Progress, Done\nJoe granted maintainer privileges for the submissions-wg repo to the\nfollowing members of the WG: Eli Miller, Yilong Zhang, Eric Nantz, Ning\nLeng, Adrian Waddell.\nAdrian then set up the Kanban board in real time. Ning and Yilong\nwill populate the Kanban with the tasks they defined.\nWe are not able to use the credentials above to access the FDA\naccount.

He mentioned that Eli Miller reported although we do\nhave credentials to use the FDA submissions gateway, these have timed\nout. Reactivating gateway access requires that I send an email to the\nFDA help desk. Eli recommends that I wait until we are nearly ready to\nsubmit before doing this.\nNext, Ning Leng presented the recently up dated slides describing the\nR Submissions Pilot. Ning will upload this slides to the repo.\n\nThe slides include the working time line for the series of pilot\nsubmissions:\nPilot1: common analysis (Q4 2021 - hopefully Oct/early Nov)\nPilot2: advanced analysis (Q2 2022)\nPilot3: alternative formatting for package submission (TBD)\nTimeline for near term work: * 9/30/2021 complete the draft code and\ndocuments along with the internal review by the execution team * 10/1 -\n10/15 2021: review by the WG * Late Oct: actual submission after\nadjudication\nThe two major asks from the execution team: 1. WG members: provide\nfeedback during the review in Oct 2. FDA: Identify potential\nreviewers\nNext, there was a discussion about the content of the submission\npackage and terminology. (9:48 in the video). This discussion also\ncontains and explanation of the strategy for encoding the R package as a\ntext file to get it through the gateway and how we will handle package\ndependencies.\nIn our documentation and communication we must be careful to\ndistinguish between the Submission package for the pilot and the R\nPackage containing R code that will be a part of the Submission package.\nNing and the team will come up with names for both of these maybe:\nPilot1 Submission for the Pilot1 Submission Package. The format\nfor the Submission package will match the folder structure for the\nsubmission portal.\nJoe then noted that we now have two R Consortium GitHub repositories\nassociated with the working group. 1. https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg is the\nprimary repository for the working group. The Kanban board project on\nthis repo is what we use to manage the submissions project. 2. The repo\nhttps://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1 is the\ncode development repo for the Pilot1 submission.\nNext, Adrian walked through the status of the tasks on the Kanban\nBoard. (20:19 on the video).\nJoe will write a blog post to describing what the submission team is\ndoing with the intention of getting more pharma companies before the\nsubmission. Mike Stackhouse will help with getting it through the PHUSE\nmarketing channels.\nThere was a discussion (43:30) about finding an FDA reviewer for the\npilot. Paul Schuette took the action item to find someone who will\nprobably be a statistician but not a formally designated FDA reviewer.\nIt was suggested that the criteria for reviewing the pilot submission\nand the criteria for the success of the project be included in the cover\nletter.\nJoe asked what would be required to communicate the success of the\npilot. Paul stated that formal approval from the FDA would be required\nfor a press release and that the project should be included as part of\nthe FDA’s Technology Modernization Action Plan (T-MAP) and the Data\nModernization Action Plan (D-MAP). It would be best to investigate this\nafter we have the proof of concept of the Pilot1.\nIn response to the question if eventually we would want to have the\npilot reviewed by a formal FDA reviewer, Paul noted that they have\nseveral R competent FDA reviewers especially among the new graduates.\nHowever, if a reviewer need help they would most likely reach out to the\nPaul’s group.\nWhen asked whether would expect reviewers to compare SAS and R\nresults, Paul suggested that we should focus on a limited definition of\nvalidation for our first submission.\nWhen asked whether we should have a future goal of having FDA\nreviewers to take the code in the submission package and and do further\nanalyses, Paul stated that they can do that now. More interesting would\nbe to have the submission package include a Shiny application for\ninteractive data visualization.\nAt the top of the hour Joe asked whether anyone on the call was\ninvolved with preparing a presentation about the Submissions project for\nthe upcoming R / Pharma conference. Paul responded that he may be. The\nFDA is still working out the details of a keynote talk in which Paul\nwill participate. The group extended an offer to help provide\nmaterial.\nThe group agreed to extend the meeting beyond the hour to review\nNing’s proposal for language to be added to section 4.1.2.10 of the\nStudy Data Technical Performance Guide. (1:03 on video) Ning suggested\nadding:\n\nSubmission of programs with their native file extensions are\nacceptable, as long as binary file formats and pre-compilde code are not\ndelivered.\n\nPaul stated that .bat files need to be excluded. This launched a\ndiscussion of how to generalize this. Paul suggested executable\nbut Doug noted that .bat files are executable on Windows but not on\nother operating systems. Doug took the action to consider how to\ndescribe the issue in a more general fashion. Paul expressed the\nessential idea as “We can open it, we can look at it, but we don’t want\nit to run.”\nIn the final minutes, Adrian asked about not having to submit .txt\nfiles. Paul suggested that this would require changes within the Agency,\nand would probably require getting the suggested changes to 4.1.2.10\npassed.\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Friday, October 1, 2020. At that\nmeeting we will decide whether we need a special session to provide\nmaterial for Paul’s presentation.\nThe zoom video\nrecording is available. Passcode: #Sk!6tXL\n\n\n\n",

Paul also noted that although it might be possible it\nis not likely that the FDA could accomplish the task requested before\nthe R/Pharma conference which begins on November 2. Those present agreed\nthat it is not necessary to tie the completion of the FDA activities to\nR/Pharma.\nAfter Ning’s presentation there was a discussion about suggestions\nfor amending the language to section 4.1.2.10 of the Study Data\nTechnical Performance Guide. Doug Kelkhoff noted that in internal\ndiscussions within Genentech the idea was floated that, as written the\ndocument may already allow passing R code in tar balls through the FDA\ngateway. If this were indeed true it would greatly simply R submissions\nsince tar balls are a common method of delivering R code. Jian Xu of the\nFDA suggest that the way to get an answer to this question is to submit\nthe question to the email address provided on the FDA eCTD webpage: Submit\nan eCTD or Standardized Data Sample to the FDA. Joe and Doug took\nthe action item to write up the question and submit\nit.\nThe group then considered a proposal by Adrian to organize the\nseveral GitHub repositories and activities of the Submissions WG using\nthe Teams features of GitHub.

Identify FDA\nmembers who can do the review. (Paul said that he has two\ncandidates.)\nBeverly asked some clarifying questions and we confirmed that We are\nusing the test gateway CDER will be the center It is a formal\npackage\nNing then went over some feedback provided by reviewers so far. The\nmost important issue was Inconsistent table layouts. However, Ning\npointed out that using multiple table layouts is intentional. The\nobjective is to have three tables follow different company specific\nstandards in order to cover tables built with different R packages. Ning\nsaid that we will add a disclaimer to the report in order to inform the\nFDA reviewers of our objectives.\nReviewers also flagged some things that are not consistent with best\npractices, such as including the number of individuals at risk on\nKaplan-Meier curves.\nJoe asked Ning to review the contents of the Pilot 1 repo\nNing explained the reviewer comments on issue #47 on the Kanban\nBoard. Ning will link the GitHub issue to a google drive containing more\nmaterial.\nThe group then discussed a timeline for the remainder of the project\nand settled on the key dates: Package to be complete and ready to go by\nend of Friday, 2021-11-19 Submission to be made on Monday 2021-11-22 Joe\ntook the action item to setup a zoom meeting for 9AM PT time on\n11-22\nThere followed an extended discussion about whether to use .txt or .r\nfor the R files. The FDA documentation says they will accept both,\nhowever, some people Including FDA folks might reject a .r file because\nthey misunderstand the documentation. On the other hand, getting a .r\nthrough would be a big win on its own.\nIt was also suggested to include a separate README document to\ndescribe how the package is constructed.\nAt 36.33 into the video Paule Schuette of the FDA\nshares a slide his colleague Heather Crandall presented recently at the\nR/Pharma conference about eCTD placement of Study Data Files.\nCTD triangleNote that R Markdown and R are listed among accepted eCTD format\ntypes.\nAt 44.33, “Scrum master” Adrian Waddell leads the\ngroup through adding new tasks to the Kanban board: https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/projects/2\nSummary of tasks leading to Submission\nFirst round of adjudication by 2021-11-11 Decide about submitting .r\nfiles 2021-11-11 Adjudication by 2021-11-18 Final Review 2021-11-19 by\nEric Nantz, Adrian and Nate Mockler Ning and Yilong will address the\ncomments.

The current\nsolution is to have people accessing the gateway on behalf of the RC use\nan R Consortium email address. JR wants to make sure\nthat this is fine with the FDA.\nAt 6:37 into the video PS begins\nproviding FDA feedback on the submission.\nThe initial findings were:\nThe submission was partially successful\nThe were no problems with the .R extensions\nThe FDA was unable to find the Pilot1wrappers package.\nHowever, the * * FDA analyst was able to generate tables\nThe FDA thinks there may have been a switch in the high bit vs. bit\nsettings and asked the WG to check this.\nThe FDA analyst was able to retrieve the pilot1wrappers\npackage from the Submission WG website, download the code and verify the\nresults\nThe FDA noted that including a dependency chart showing the 2nd and\n3rd order dependencies would be very helpful. If this were and actual\nsubmission, at least one IR request would have been generated.\nOn behalf of the WG, JR thanked the FDA team for\nmaking extra effort to retrieve the wrapper package and run the\ncode.\nIn the subsequent discussion it was determined that the FDA analysts\noverlooked the instructions, buried in the ADRG, to unpack the\npilot1wrappers from the file r0plg.txt. Once this was\nclarified HC, the FDA analyst, was able to execute the\ncommand and unpack the pilot1wrappers package.\nHY noted that in her experience, submissions with R\ncode tend to be ad hoc, and that it is common to include a\nREADME file. The WG took note and agreed that it would be a good idea to\ninclude a README file that highlights the key steps, maybe\nby referring to the ADRG.\nNext, followed a discussion about the requested dependency chart tree\ndiagram. PS noted that the importance of dependencies\ndepends on the setting. When running from a standard machine, FDA\nanalysts are able to pull packages from the internet. However, when\nrunning from one of their scientific enclaves high performance computing\nenvironments they must port in the packages. To illustrate the problem\nwith dependencies HC showed (See screen capture) the error\nmessages generated by calling R packages previously installed on her\nmachine, but which did not have the dependencies installed that are\nrequired to run the submission code.\n\nThe problem seems to be that every file in the submission needs the\nlibrary calls. This problem needs to be addressed.\nHC also identified a problem of not having write\npermissions. See the following screen capture.\n\nThe temporary solution seems to be to copy the file into a temporary\nfolder. This problem needs more thought.\nIt was agreed that the WG should produce a document about\nestablishing the proper environment. AW suggests that\nthere are two possible actions: 1. Copying to a local folder might clear\nup most of the problems 2. If not, the WG should look into environment\nreproducibility\nPS noted that the FDA does not need to run on a\ncentral server. This implies that we can assume FDA analysts running on\ntheir local environments for the near future.\nPS suggested having a pre-submission meeting\nexplaining everything that is necessary to get everything installed and\nworking.\nAW suggested that we set up the submission assuming\nthat each file will be run from a fresh R session, and that perhaps we\ncould run some tests to see if the environment is as is expected.\nNL asked about writing a blog post about the pilot\nsubmission. The WG agreed to write up the post and have\nPS and HC review.\nYL asked about redoing the submission.\nPS said indicated that is common practice.\nNL said that she and HC would like\nto schedule a separate meeting early next year to discuss where the\nvarious participating companies are in the process of making R\nsubmissions. Please let NL know if you are interested\nin participating.\nThe next meeting is set for 9:00 AM Pacific Time on Friday, January\n7, 2022.\n\n\n\n",

We received written feedback from the FDA which is available\nin the submissions repository here.\nThere were a few findings with the pilot:\nA mislableed treatment arm (This is a potential bug)\nA rounding issue\nTable fomatting\nNL noted that our execution team was not able to recreate the\nrounding issue, and asked PS is it would be possible to for us to look\nat the FDA code. This is possible, but needs to be cleared with\nmanagement and may take a couple of weeks,\nNing and the other members of the submission execution team are\nlooking into these and hope to be able to submit a follow up to Pilot 1\nin several weeks. Ning asked if the FDA would be willing to review the\nresubmission of Pilot 1. PS said that this would be fine.\nThe discussion then moved to the contents of Pilot 2. PS noted that\nwith submitting .R files we already met some of the goals we had been\nplanning for Pilot 2.\nTo begin the discussion JR asked: what kinds of things have been\nconsidered difficult to do in submissions in the past and what could we\ndo that would be impressive from the FDA’s point of view?\nPS suggested package versioning and archival issues\nNL suggested four topics that have come up in previous\ndiscussions.\nPackage versioning\nUsing Docker\nAlternative data formats to sas7bdat\nShiny\nEN agreed that these were the top issues, and noted that using a\ncontainer such as Docker would also solve the package versioning.\nPS remarked that doing anything with data formatting is unlikely at\nthis time. Two recent pilots failed to come up with an alternative. This\nis “not the hill to die on” right now. It is probably an issue that is\nworthy of broader discussion with other groups such as ASA, DIA, or\nPHUSE. PS suggested looping in Heather Crandall and OBI, the\nOffice of Business Informatics.\nPS also noted that Docker has made changes to licensing so that FDA\nis not able to play with local installations of Docker. EN said that he\nwas aware of these issues and suggested alternatives such as podman which he believes to be the first\ncandidate to investigate. PS stated that any container technology would\nhave to be approved by IT. He also noted that the FDA is currently using\nan obsolete version of Docker, and that upgrading to a newer version\nwould have to go through the FDA approval process. Also, the FDA\nsecurity team will not let containers have access to the hard drive. The\ngroup concurred that since getting Docker approved would not be any\neasier than podman the group should explore this new technology. EN\noffered to take the lead on this and enter the task into the Kanban\nboard.\nPS suggested that since we have just shown that we can get a package\nthrough the gateway, the next step might be to turn a shiny app into a\npackage and pass it through the gateway. EN confirmed that this is\nindeed possible and noted that the golem package can do\nthis and deploy the shiny app locally without having to go to a\nserver.\nYZ noted that he has seen several linkedin\nposts about using Shiny for submissions and asked if that was\nhappening in this group. PB stated that this Shiny submissions effort is\nbeing run by the R/Pharma group. They are planning to start holding\nmonthly meeting, the first being at the end of January. R/Pharma wants\nto focus on the technical issues.\nThe group agreed that the path forward with Shiny as a package is\nmuch more straightforward than using containers, and suggested that we\nsettle on Shiny for Pilot 2 and Containers for Pilot 3.\nThe discussion then turned on which Shiny app we should select. TD\nsuggested the teal package that Roche is working on and noted that Roche\nis planning to make this open source. The group agreed that the source\ncode of any Shiny package submitted should be open source.\nAt 30:03 into the video, TL demonstrated the teal package. After the\ndemo, the group discussed the benefits of submitting a complicated\npackage like teal which has several interesting features versus a simple\napp that meets the basic requirements. PS noted that ideally we would\nwant to launch server from a local PC and not touch a server. To do\notherwise would require the FDA to involve a special contractor and\nfunding. The group decided to use a simple app and NL suggested wrapping\nthe Pilot 1 modules into a Shiny app.\nAt 46:15 into the video, TL demonstrates calling different packages\nfrom a Shiny app.\nEN agreed to open up a second repo for development of Pilot 2. We\nwill keep use the same setup as Pilot 1 and have the kanban board on the\nmain submissions repo point to the Pilot 2 repo.\nJR said that he would follow up with PHUSE about work they may be\ndoing on the formatting issue.\nNL asked about accumulus\nsynergy, an FDA and cross industry looking at cloud solutions. Would\nthere be a way to connect our container effort with accumulus? The group\nsuggested searching for a contact.\nJR noted that before the next submission of Pilot 1 we must write to\nthe FDA to reopen the gateway.\nThe next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM Pacific Time\nFriday, February 4, 2022.\n\n\n\n",

Every submission will have two\nrepositories: a development repo and a repo that follows the FDA ECTD\nstructure that contains the files that will go through the gateway.\nsubmissions-wg\nis he umbrella repo that contains the kanban\nboard for the project.\nsubmissions-pilot1\nis the development repository for the Pilot 1 submission\nsubmission-pilot1-to-fda\ncontains the only the files that will go to the FDA\nsubmissions-pilot2\nis the development repo for Pilot 2\n[https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot2]\nThe group then summarized the present status of the project. The\nPilot 1 submission of last year was mostly successful but the FDA\nresponse flagged a couple of problem areas: * An apparent but the\nresulted in column labels being switched * An unexplained rounding\ndiscrepancy in a p-value may be due to different operating systems. *\nSeveral good practice issues to address\nHSC who helped to conduct the FDA review of the Pilot 1 submission\noffered to share the code that flagged the rounding error. She will\nenter it as an issue on the submissions repo.\nThe Pilot 1 team has been working on the Pilot 1 resubmission. The\nteam will will review the FDA code and test it on multiple operating\nsystems. They expect to be able to resubmit in a couple of weeks. NL\nasked if HSC could look over the new code before they do so. Assuming\nthat the resubmission goes well the group will prepare a blog for\nposting on the RC blog.\nNL then reviewed plans of the Pilot 2 shiny submission. It is\nenvisioned as a simple four tab Shiny app that contains the same\nanalyses as the previous submission. The plan is to use the Roche teal\nframework because of its filtering structure.\nYZ then outlined work required to complete the Pilot 2 work and\nidentified three dependencies:\nteal must become open source\nThe scope of Pilot 2 needs to be clarified\nA template needs to be developed for submission documentation that\nincludes a Shiny app.\nYZ recommended that a separate Pilot 2 documentation team be formed\nto work on the Shiny documentation in parallel with the code development\nfor Pilot 2.\nEN said that he had experience preparing this sort of documentation\nand agreed to lead the documentation task.\nJR asked when teal would become open source and whether the fact that\nit is not now open source prohibiting other companies from contributing\nto the project. TL responded that project to open source teal is\ncurrently with the Roche lawyers and that he expects it will be complete\nwithin three months. No one present believed that not currently having\nteal as open source code was prohibiting participation. Everyone will be\nable to run the Shiny app from a public website. EN noted that work on\ninfrastructure can proceed in parallel.\nThe team working on Pilot 2 said that a submission in Q2 is\nfeasible.\nCurrently there are not plans for multiple Pilot 2 submissions.\nHowever, it is likely that we would want to have a submission in the\nfuture that includes a more complicated Shiny app. JR noted that it\nwould be optimal if the FDA could provide guidance on what features they\nwould like to see in a more robust Shiny app.\nMoving beyond Shiny JR asked if by the end of the year we would be\nlooking a submission based on container technology. EN remarked that\nthat is the direction the group would like to see but since Docker is\nnot suitable (because of licensing issues) it will be necessary to\nresearch alternative container technology.\nJR noted that having 29 people in the meeting indicated that there\nwas considerable industry interest in the work being done and whether it\nwould be possible to recruit a team to do the research for long range\nprojects. He asked group members who are not involved in immediate work\nto get involved in long term planning. EN noted that we definitely need\nto help from the regulatory side to help effect any changes that would\nhave to be made to make use of container technology.\nThe discussion then turned to the possibility of making a submission\nto CDE\nthe Chinese health authority. (See issue #62 )\nThey are trying their own submissions gateway. They have shared\nvalidation software with Roche that could check a submission. NL\nsuggested that we undertake an effort to see if we could validate a test\nsubmission using the Chinese supplied software. If that worked the only\nadditional work to be done to make a viable submission to the CDE would\nbe to translate the documentation into Chinese.\nNL asked if anyone has contacts with the CDE that could review a test\nsubmission from the Submissions WG. JR asked EN if she could check with\nPS about possible FDA contacts with the CDE.\nBF noted that her company, EQRx, has the opposite problem. They have\nhad a compound approved by the CEA and now want to submit it to the FDA.\nShe noted that there are high level regulations about the transfer of\ndata between China and the FDA. The CDE has an HGR application that must\nbe approved by the Human Genetic Resources Agency for China. HY offered\nthat she has some experience dealing with the CDE, having done two or\nthree submissions to the CED in the past when she worked for Novartis.\nAt that time the CDE accepted the FDA package.\nThe discussion they turned to other countries HY noted that she is\nworking on a submission to the Japanese PMDA\nwhich the group aggreed is more strict than the CDE an offered to look\nfor a contact there.\nYL noted that the German authorities have strict requirements about\nthe table formats.\nJR asked if there is there is a European authority that we should\nhave on our radar. Apparently, the EMA does not presently require a data\nsubmission, but that may be changing. TL noted that they have had a\nproof of concept sharing data with the EMA.\nYL also raised the possibility of following the PHUSE\nADGR template. He suggested that we contact PHUSE and ask if they\nwould be willing to update the template so that it does not specify SAS\ndata sets. JR agreed to look for a contact within PHUSE. We would want a\nlanguage agnostic template.\nNL noted that this would be a good time to revisit our effort to\ndevelop suggested language for section 14 (issue\n#38).\nJR suggested that we need some high level planning document to\ncapture all of the ideas presented.\nAt 47:10 in the video NL explains the contents of the Submission WG\nGI Hub sites.\nSome useful links from the\nchat box\nR Consortium GitHub sites: https://github.com/RConsortium/\nWG web page: https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/\nTracker for the pilot1 submission: https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda/issues\nhttps://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/issues/38\nIssue filed for pilot 2 documentation : https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/issues/63\n\n\n\n",

NL noted\nthat the content of the resubmission included:\nFixing the table heading bug\nAddressing the rounding error that was due to using 1.96 in the\ncalculation of a confidence as opposed to using the exact value\nImplementing some best practices that had been suggested by the\nFDA\nNL also stated that although we heard back informally from the FDA,\nwe have not yet received a formal reply. PS confirmed that the FDA\nreviewer was able to open the submission and access the contents. PS\nstated that he would check with his supervisor to provide an update, and\nnoted that the fact that we are still going through the test process and\nnot through an actual submission, might account for the slow\nresponse.\nJR asked BS if there was any channel we should use to communicate\nwith the FDA when we had questions. BS suggested that sending an email\nto edata@fda.hhs.gov might be helpful.\nNL then provided an update for Pilot which involves sending a\nshiny app through the gateway, but using the same data set\nand same analyses as used in Pilot 1.\nHY has begun programming the shiny app\nEN and EM are working on improving the formatting of tables in the\nshiny app\nThe app will be published to a shiny.io server in order to get\nfeedback from the WG\nEN is leading the effort to write the ADRG reviewers guide. A\nconversation has started in the issue tracker.\nWork is going well NL and EN believe that will have something to\nshow in a month or so.\nThere was a short discussion on how much documentation the\nshiny app needs. EN and others stressed that the goal of\nthis pilot is to prove the concept of passing the app through the\ngateway what is being planned will be more than sufficient.\nJR asked if we have he bandwidth to begin thinking about Pilot 3. He\nstated that people who are discovering the WG are asking how they can\nget involved, and asked if there were certain task we could point them\nto and also are there any particular skill sets we need?\nThe WG thought that we do have the bandwidth to assimilate new\nmembers and run parallel tasks.\nHY offered that she is in contact with colleagues who are working\nwith the Japanese PMDA, and she should be able to have some information\nto share in Q2. She noted that the Japanese are beginning to accept R\nsubmissions.\nThe WG agreed that we should initiate new projects for Pilot 1\nsubmissions for both Japan and China. We should stand up new repos for\neach of these projects and begin to sub teams to work on them in\nparallel with the other WG projects.\nJR asked if the technical approach we have taken with Pilot 1 for the\nFDA would work for Pilot 1 Japan. NL noted that we would Japanese and\nChinese translation for all documents submitted to Japan and China\nrespectively. However, the strategy of wrapping the R code into text for\ntransmission, passing it through the gateway, and then unpacking it is\nappropriate.\nJR asked we need help researching container technology for Pilot 3.\nEN replied that he has already begun this research and his goal is to\nidentify multiple orchestrators of container technology. He would like\nto have at least two potential solutions. Singularity\nand Rocker ar both\npossibilities.\nEN agreed to put an issue into the main repo and stand up a Pilot 3\nrepo for the project details. JR noted that getting the folks behind the\nRocker project would open up even more connections and opportunities to\nget help.\nJR pointed out the as we progress further through the different\nprojects we will need help writing blog posts and communicating what we\nhave done. He then asked if anyone was planning to send a talk to rstudio::conf which will\nhappen in July or useR!\n2022. NL offered that she has submitted to SDSS and would be\nhappy to submit something similar to rstudio::conf. NL will start and\nissue to discuss upcoming projects.\nEN offered to put a contact list on the website to organize people\nwishing to help.\nNL noted that many of the WG members are also participating in Shiny\nfor Submissions Task Force and suggested we have a standing agenda\nto coordinate the two groups.\nThe WG will next meet at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, April 1,\n2022.\n\n\n\n",

JBR stated that it is great benefit\nto the R Community and to the R Consortium that all interested folks can\njoin working groups. There is no requirement that working members be\nemployed by companies who are members of the R Consortium. He noted\nthat, so far, having large numbers of people attend the monthly meeting\nof the submission working group meeting has not been a problem.\nJBR also noted that small teams of WG members have been meeting\nseparately from the general meeting to accomplish the technical work and\nasked that all of these please make an effort to take minutes and upload\nthem to the appropriate repository. These meetings can be very brief\nlimited to who attended and some bullet points of what was\naccomplished.\nJBR then ask NL to give a brief overview of WG activity. NL stated\nthat in addition to the Pilot 1 team, there are two groups working on\nprojects.\nThe Pilot 2 submission that is developing a shiny app based on\nthe analyses developed in the Pilot 1 submission. This app will then be\nmade into an R package, wrapped up with the analysis and data used in\nPilot 1 and then submitted through the FDA gateway. The team working on\nthis meets every two weeks and has already developed a preliminary\nversion of the shiny app. They will ask the extended working group to\nreview the draft shiny app. if all goes well they think they should be\nable to make the Pilot 2 submission in two to three months.\nAnother subgroup has just been formed to make a Pilot 1\nsubmission the PMDA, the Japanese health authority. This will\nessentially be the Pilot 1 submission to the FDA with some translate\nmaterials. SH and HW are are members of this team. TL asked to be\nincluded.\nAt 16:16 minutes into the video TL demonstrated the preliminary of\nthe Pilot 2 Shiny\nApp. He described how filtering and subsetting works.\n\nJBR suggested that eventually the shiny app should be deployed to an\nR Consortium property.\nThe group they began a discussion about how the Shiny App would fit\ninto a typical FDA workflow. PS that his group has not yet dealt with\nany Shiny apps and they are only in the preliminary stages of developing\ntheir own apps. He also remarked that there would still be a significant\namount of preliminary work to set up for an analysis.\nPS said that an issue with Shiny will be reproducibility. He remarked\nthat he is following the work of Joe Cheng and Carson Sievert on the\nShiny Meta project which will generate code that captures the Shiny app\nsettings to allow users to independently rerun an analysis.\nPS remarked that the ability to do subgroup analysis would be a value\nadd to the reviewers. The Shiny app would be an auxiliary tool. The main\ntask would still be to do an independent analysis of the models and show\nthat the models are appropriately developed and executed.\nRJ then asked PS whether the FDA has the infrastructure to receive a\nShiny app and deploy it throughout the enterprise. PS replied that do\nnot yet have the capabilities for enterprise deployment, but that two\ndifferent possible solutions are being discussed: one of these is OCS\nthe Office of Computational Science.\nRight now, the FDA is running things locally. The best that the FDA\ncan do is to install a shiny app and submission package on a number of\nworkstations which would provide remote access to FDA analysts. The\nworkstations would not be networked. At the present time, the FDA does\nnot permit analysts to use servers.\nJBR asked PS: “Given the FDA environment as it is now, not as we all\nwould like it to be, is there anything the we can do do facilitate your\nworkflows?”\nPS replied that the FDA is in the process of updating its workflows\nincluding the use of GitLab, but that he does not know how they could\nmake things easier without achieving the enterprise environment being\ndiscussed. JBR remarked that if any of the FDA\nJBR if anyone in the meeting was working on the containers project.\nEM stated that he would like to be involved. NL noted that Eric Nantz\nhas already begun collecting documentation. JBR pointed out that\nresearching the use of containers for R submissions would be a project\nthat newcomers to the Submissions WG could help with.\nIn summary, the WG has two active project and two that are just\nbeginning: 1. The Shiny app for the Pilot 2 submission 2. Research on\ncontainers for Pilot 3 3. A Pilot 1 submission for Japan 4. A pilot 1\nsubmission for China\nThe next meeting of the WG will be on Friday May 6, 2022 at 9AM\nPacific Time.\n\n\n\n",
