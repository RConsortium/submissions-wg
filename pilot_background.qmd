## Pilot principles: 

Provide open examples of submitting R-based clinical trial data/analysis packages to FDA. 

- All pilots will be submitted from R consortium (non-profit identity) to FDA. Simulated data will be used.
- All data, codes and documents will be fully available to public. 
- FDA Staff will be engaged to reproduce analysis results.
- Submitter and FDA Staff will provide feedback on current process/system
- Contributions from multiple companies/organizations are preferred. Avoid bias to any company/organization specific tools.
