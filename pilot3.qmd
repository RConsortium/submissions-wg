---

**Goals**:

1.  Deliver a publicly accessible R-based Submission to the FDA
1.  Expand on the work done in [Submission Pilot 1](pilot1.qmd), by now utilizing R to generate ADaM datasets.

**Timeline**: Submitted to FDA on August 28th, 2023

**Data and analysis scope**:
  
- ADaMs created using R (SDTM `.xpt` sourced from the CDISC Pilot study)
- TLFs created using R (ADaMs `.xpt` sourced from the ADaMs generated in R by the Pilot 3 team)
- SDTM data is taken from CDISC Pilot Study using `xpt` files
