The meeting was recorded and the [video](https://zoom.us/rec/share/S3CjidPqOBSwSHo7xW3VUu_aUXKS9RdB3rNb07hWWkeyze5SthawUq5I8gnzQ2th.kpiljMfkqrlkuUJf?startTime=1704474237000) is available.


## Pilot 3

HyeSoo presented an update on the continuing FDA evaluation of Pilot 3. 

* Using the R generated ADaM data sets, the FDA reviewers were able to replicate the results of the demographic, efficacy, primary and KM plot analyses

* The reviewers compared the results of the four analyses between Pilot 1 and Pilot 3.
  * Primary output in Pilot 3 was different from the Pilot 1 result due to the QC findings
  * QC findings in ADRG include all of the discrepancies between the original ADaM datasets
  * The discrepancies in ADADAS data sets cause different primary analyses outputs
  * This is an issue from the CDISC ADADAS
  * It is not clear which CDISC file, the file from Pilot 1 or the file from Pilot 3, is correct.
  
The following figure compares the Pilot 1 and Pilot 3 primary output. Discrepancies are highlighted.

Additional FDA questions included:

* Why is there an indication in the output of LOCF, "Last observation carried forward" when the original data set had no missing data?
* There was no statistical analysis plan included in the submission.
* **Action:** Ben Straub will confer with the Pilot 3 team to answer these questions and review the discrepancy problems between Pilots 1 and 3.
* **Action:** Paul and HyeSoo will discuss whether we need to resubmit Pilot 3
The next meeting of the working group will be on Friday, February 2, 2024 at 9AM Pacific Time.
* All agreed that if a resubmission of Pilot 3 is required, we will consider submitting via a .zip file.


There was some discussion about what we could do to improve the quality control of our submissions. 

* The group agreed that we should have a check list to compare items against a Pilot 1 source of truth.
* We should have additional reviewers who are not close to the work.
* The idea of using AI tools to check consistency was mentioned.

## Upcoming Webinar
