<section id="adrg-formats" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adrg-formats">ADRG Formats</h2>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo shared additional feedback from FDA on the file formats used for sending the Analysis Data Reviewers Guide (ADRG) in clinical submissions:
<ul>
<li>For an FDA submission, a final ADRG document should be submitted for review. It is not recommended for reviewers to take additional steps such as rendering the ADRG using Quarto or another technical publishing system/package.</li>
<li>The PDF format is required for submitting an ADRG. However there is a possibility of conducting a pilot test with submitting the ADRG in alternative formats such as the source Quarto file <code>.qmd</code> as well as the HTML output format <code>.html</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The rational for submitting an ADRG in HTML format was discussed. Eric and Joel shared that having the HTML format brings the possibility of interactive displays (such as tables) which could be beneficial, especially for a submission including a large amount of programs and TLG outputs.</li>
<li>The group agreed that sending the ADRG source file in <code>.qmd</code> format would not be as beneficial in the current stage, as the rendered document itself is the main focus.</li>
<li>Future pilots such as Pilot 5 could be the first project to test submitting the ADRG in HTML format</li>
<li>While Pilot 4 (WebAssembly Shiny app) formally submitted the ADRG in PDF format, Eric created a separate version of the ADRG in HTML format as a technical preview, which can be viewed at <a href="https://rpodcast.quarto.pub/pilot4-webassembly-adrg/">this link</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ectd-and-zip-archives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ectd-and-zip-archives">eCTD and Zip Archives</h2>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo shared clarifications on the current eCTD specifications for including a ZIP archive file in a submission package. The accepted location is M5.3, with the permissible uses of grouping large sets of aECG XML files.</li>
<li>The method of including both the data sets and programs in the ZIP archive (utilized by the Pilot 4 WebAssembly submission) is not permissible.</li>
<li>Eric will set up a targeted discussion with Paul and HyeSoo in January 2025 on how to best utilized the ZIP format in the future Pilot 4 Docker Container submission.</li>
<li>Questions were raised on the possible inclusion of additional archive formats such as compressed Tar archives <code>.tar.gz</code> in the eCTD specifications. Currently that format is not supported, but it could be explored for discussion with FDA next year.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dataset-json-overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset-json-overview">Dataset-JSON Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sam Hume from CDISC joined the meeting to share CDISC’s efforts in creating JSON datasets for clinical submissions, and feedback from previous pilots with FDA. You can view slides from Sam’s previous presentation on Dataset-JSON from the 2024 CDISC &amp; TMF Europe Interchange conference at <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024-EU-Interchange-Session-6B-SamHume-final.pdf">this link</a>, as well as the slides from a Public Review webinar held by CDISC at <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Dataset-JSON-v1-1-Public-Review.pdf">this link</a>.</li>
<li>Many of the standards in data exchanges are now using the JSON format as default.</li>
<li>There is increasing interest in additional structures besides the traditional rectangular/tabular approach, such as in the Electronic Study Protocol Template M11 module.</li>
<li>CDISC ran a pilot within CDER at FDA to verify the Dataset-JSON format could be successfull transferred and viewed by reviewers. The testing was deemed successful.</li>
<li>A mix of tools were utilized in the pilot. One of the over-arching goals is to ensure that the Dataset-JSON format is agonostic to the tools/languages used to ingest the format. For example, multiple languages like SAS, R, and Python should be able to import and analyze the data in this format.</li>
<li>Recently the Dataset-JSON version 1.1 was released, addressing feedback generated from the earlier pilot. You can view the updated user guide for v1.1 at <a href="https://wiki.cdisc.org/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=230658980#content/view/230658980">this link</a>.</li>
<li>Mike Stackhouse shared that the <a href="https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson/">`{datasetjson}</a> package, tasked with reading and writing CDISC Dataset JSON files, is in active development to accomodate v1.1 of the Dataset-JSON format.</li>
<li>Nick and Mike would welcome collaboration from others on the package updates.</li>
<li>Another important fix ongoing for the package is switching to a more performant JSON processing backend, as detailed in <a href="https://github.com/atorus-research/datasetjson/issues/32">issue 32</a> of the package’s GitHub repository.</li>
<li>In light of learning about the successful pilot, questions were asked on whether our submissions group should still initiate a new Pilot that leverages JSON format instead of XPT. Sam and others in the call concurred that the pilot would still be worthwhile to conduct, as it could be the first test of the new Dataset-JSON v1.1 specification in a realistic setting.</li>
<li>Ben shared that this could be a great opportunity for others in the working group to take the lead on this new Pilot, now being called Pilot 5. Ben will take on the task of creating a new channel in Slack dedicated to Pilot 5 within the R Consortium Slack Channel.</li>
</ul>

<section id="admin-housekeeping" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="admin-housekeeping">Admin &amp; Housekeeping</h2>
<ul>
<li>The group agreed to keep the current cadence of having the Submissions WG meetings on the first Friday of every month, with adjustments as needed.</li>
<li>A few members on the call were not clear on how to get invitations properly on their calendar. Theresa shared the ways anyone can add the working group meetings on their calendar. However the group agreed that having a dedicated page on the Working Group site for how to join the group and the various communication platforms would be a beneficial.</li>
<li>Eric will create a new page on the site to hold this information. In fact that page is now live! Visit the <a href="join.qmd">How to Join</a> page for complete details.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-data-reviewers-guide-adrg-updates">Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>The PhUSE working group on open-source metadata documentation is working to update the ADRG template to better support open-source submissions, with feedback from FDA and industry representatives.</li>
<li>Lovemore gave a recap of a presentation about the ADRG workstream at the PHUSE FDA quarterly meeting</li>
<li>The team discussed the potential use of Quarto (QMD) and HTML formats for more accessible, navigable submissions, as well as potential supplementary documents for open-source submissions. Paul confirmed that R Markdown (<code>.rmd</code>) format has already been approved as a file type.</li>
<li>Joel and Lovemore will set up a future meeting to gather additional industry feedback as a first step to developing a new prototype of the ADRG using enhanced metadata and the Quarto format.</li>
<li>While Quarto is an approved software package at the FDA, and Quarto file format (<code>.qmd</code>) is part of the approved file types within the <strong>Modeling and Simulation</strong> section of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download">eCTD Format Specifications</a> document.</li>
<li>Paul and HyeSoo will touch base with Helena Spiglin (part of the FDA committee currently assessing the <code>.json</code> formats as an alternative to SAS Transport <code>.xpt</code>) for confirming the Quarto and HTML formats can be added as supported formats for ADRG submissions.</li>

<section id="data-set-json-format-and-alternative-data-formats" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-set-json-format-and-alternative-data-formats">Data Set JSON Format and Alternative Data Formats</h2>
<ul>
<li>The team discussed exploring JSON and alternative data formats like <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Parquet</a>, given the large data sizes in modern studies.</li>
<li>Although the industry largely uses JSON, there are concerns about its efficiency for high-volume data. Parquet, used internally by several team members, offers a promising alternative, particularly for big data applications.</li>
<li>For a comprehensive overview of the benefits and tradeoffs between JSON, Parquet, and other formats, see the recent R/Pharma 2024 presentation <strong>An arrow towards the future: A critical look at data formats for clinical reporting</strong> by Craig Gower-Page (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipvcRPr0eig">recording link</a>).</li>
<li>The FDA has primarily used JSON but is open to considering alternatives like Parquet with further testing and demonstrations.</li>
<li>Paul mentioned he is not aware of previous efforts to convert the publically available CDISC data sets utilized in the previous pilot submissions to JSON format and then perform statistical analyses.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity for Pilot 5</strong>: Using the structure of Pilot 3 as a template, leverage JSON as the format to assess performance. Ben Straub will draft a proposal for an initial review at the next Submissions Working Group meeting in December.</li>
<li>Nicholas Masel shared that the <a href="https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson/">{datasetjson}</a> R package will need updates to align with the latest schema (1.1) to ensure compatability with the future Pilot 5.</li>
<li>In addition, Nick and Ben will gather input from industry colleagues and the FDA to determine if Parquet is a viable alternative to JSON for high-volume data in future pilots, and discuss any potential technical or bureaucratic limitations with FDA.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="future-pilot-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-pilot-projects">Future Pilot Projects</h2>
<p>The team plans to prioritize two future pilot projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot 5: A repeat of Pilot 3 but using JSON format to assess package performance and ADRG requirements.</li>
<li>Comprehensive Benchmark Pilot: A longer-term pilot for H2 2025 using a large, realistic simulated data set to evaluate JSON vs.&nbsp;Parquet for performance, usability, and compatibility.</li>

<ul>
<li>The submissins pilot 4 (web-assembly version) was transferred on September 20, 2024 successfully and received by the FDA reviewers through the eCTD gateway transfer. The news was also shared in this <a href="https://r-consortium.org/posts/using-r-to-submit-research-to-the-fda-pilot-4-successfully-submitted/">announcement post</a> on the R Consortium blog.</li>
<li>Hye Soo informed that their internal reviewer computers required an update to R version 4.4.1 to match the version used in the pilot submission. She also verified that there were no issues in rendering the Shiny application with the web-assembly method of execution.</li>
<li>A small issue with column labels being switched on Primary Table was identified (a legacy issue that unfortunately was carried forward from an earlier version of the Pilot 1 output). While this is not a critical issue for the scope of pilot 4, Ben Straub shared how leveraging continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) for verifying the integrity of the data and outputs could be helpful.</li>
<li>The full review of the submission is ongoing.</li>
<li>Eric Nantz shared that the Docker container version of Pilot 4 is undergoing additional testing with the working group, and the goal is to have a transfer to the FDA reviewers in November (exact timing TBD).</li>
<li>Communication with the Nature journal on a potential manuscript is ongoing. Michael Kane noted that additional journals such as the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/index">Journal of Statistical Software</a> are another possibility for sharing the concepts of web-assembly in clinical submissions.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="realistic-pilot-submissions">Realistic Pilot Submissions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The previous pilot submissions have been successful with the higher-level goals of demonstrating open-source software including R is a viable method for producing the typical submission deliverables.</li>
<li>However, the mock clinical data sets and collection of outputs are a much smaller scale than a typical clinical submission which routinely involve many data sets and clinical TFLs.</li>
<li>Bringing members outside of this core group to lead a realistic pilot submission grouup could be valuable in many fronts.</li>
<li>Paul Schutte shared that there isn’t a cononical data set applicable to the life sciences space in the way that widely-known data sets such as iris and more recently <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html">Palmer Penguins</a>.</li>
<li>With the lack of public de-identified clinical data sets on the scale of the typical submission, creating these realistic sets via robust simulation could be a path forward.</li>
<li>Action item: Create a subgroup of those interested in this effort.</li>
<li>Sources such as <a href="https://data.projectdatasphere.org/projectdatasphere/html/home">Project Datasphere</a> are a way to obtain ADAM data sets involving treatment and standard of care data sets (with many oncology studies). One must request access before data are shared.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-data-reviewers-guide-adrg">Analysis Data Reviewers Guide (ADRG)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Joel Laxamana is co-leading a new PHUSE working group on updating a template ADRG to account for open-source software such as R. A preliminary site for that working group is available at <a href="https://phuse-org.github.io/OSDocuMeta/" class="uri">https://phuse-org.github.io/OSDocuMeta/</a>. Note that it is in the early stages of development, but it will be updated as progress is made.</li>
<li>Attendees from the meeting interested in learning more and joining that working group are encouraged to contact Joel.</li>
<li>With the success of our previous pilots, attendees expressed interested in using a similar workflow to provide support for the PHUSE working group. For instance, Sam Parmar has already created a template ADRG in Quarto that could serve as inspiration: <a href="https://github.com/parmsam/quarto-adrg" class="uri">https://github.com/parmsam/quarto-adrg</a></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4-web-assembly">Pilot 4 (Web-Assembly)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eric shared that the repository is just about ready for transfer. The tentative date for the transfer of the Pilot 4 bundle through the eCTD gateway is set for September 20, 2024.</li>
<li>Paul and HyeSoo asked if there is a desire for a small test before the transfer. Eric mentioned that from his perspective a possible issue could be access to the WebR binary package repository, which is a different repository than the CRAN repository and its mirrors around the world. Eric mentioned that there will be two different ways the web-assembly bundle can be executed:
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Utilize the pre-compiled bundle that contains the R packages as well as the application itself. In this way, the WebR binary package repository CDN should not need to be contacted from the reviewer’s machine</li>
<li>Method 2: Compile the web-assembly bundle upon first launch of the application, which will need to access the WebR binary package repository CDN to install the packages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eric will arrange a dedicated testing meeting for the Docker container setup and testing to see if a Docker container can be built on the reviewers’ machines.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-manuscript-on-web-assembly-in-life-sciences">Potential Manuscript on Web-Assembly in Life Sciences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paul requested a change in the proposed title of the paper to remove any references to “timelines.” Having any hint of that terminology could introduce additional policy issues during the disclosure process on their side.</li>
<li>The plan is to propose the manuscript for publication in Nature. It was noted that the fee for open-access manuscripts is $11,000, and we would need to explore sponsorship from the Consortium or other avenues to address that cost.</li>
<li>Eric will follow up with the editor he collaborated with on the recent Nature article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00725-1">No installation required: how WebAssembly is changing scientific computing</a> to inquiry on interest from the editors at Nature to pursue this manuscript</li>
<li>Michael Kane mentioned that he is an editor of the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/index">Journal of Statistical Software</a> and there could be an opportunity to publish a similar manuscript on this topic in that journal.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upcoming-conferences">Upcoming Conferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eric asked the Pilot 3 team if anyone from that group would like to join a presentation at the upcoming R/Pharma virtual conference focusing on clinical submissions. Both Joel and Ben expressed interest in joining that session. Eric will provide more details on timing and expectations once the R/Pharma program is completed.</li>
<li>Michael noted that the R-Medicine conference next year would also be a potential venue for an additional presentation.</li>

<section id="future-pilot-ideas-for-2025" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-pilot-ideas-for-2025">Future Pilot Ideas for 2025</h2>
<p>A key focus of the meeting was to brainstorm on potential topics for future pilots in the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused pilot on the ADRG template (more background in the ADRG section above)</li>
<li>Working with the repositories working group on a robust container image for a reproducible computing environment</li>
<li>A more comprehensive submission that closely resembles a “real” submission (e.g.&nbsp;a large number of deliverables and outputs)
<ul>
<li>A consistent piece of feedback received at previous conference talks is that the current pilots only have sparse content (only 4 tables and a figure).</li>
<li>At the time the previous pilots launched, the publically-available CDISC data was the best avenue for data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explore creating a large-scale mock clinical trial data via simulation methods.
<ul>
<li>On top of providing a rich source to generate many submission deliverables, this set could also be used as a robust source to test how statistical methods perform, enabling these assessments to be done truly in the open instead of behind company doors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="additional-topics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-topics">Additional Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ben asked the FDA reviewers if the approaches used in the Pilot submissions could inform a future guidance document by FDA on using open-source software for submissions. Paul mentioned that they officially will not likely make any suggestions on the use of open-source software, as current guidances are meant to be high-level and will stay software-agnostic.</li>
<li>It is possible FDA could share that sponsors should follow best practices, whatever they happen to be.</li>
<li>Paul recommended our group work closely with PHUSE who have provided best practices in the past. One potential avenue to explore is the use of the JSON format instead of XPT. Atorus Research has open-sourced a package called <a href="https://github.com/atorus-research/datasetjson"><code>{datasetjson}</code></a> to address the viewing/importing of this format.</li>
</ul>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h2>
<p>Hye Soo reported that the Pilot 3 review has not yet been completed by he FDA authorities. There are no known problems. The delay is most likely due to a summer slowdown.</p>
<p>Before the meeting Joel Laxamana shared a list of recent and upcoming Pilot 3 related talks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>[Pilot 3 Demo : R/Medicine 2024](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_2024/Program.html)</li>

<li>Joel will also be a part of a PHUSE WG project coming up. Yet to be started, but will share more details soon.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Acton</strong>: Ning will begin a draft blog post for Pilot 3 to be posted after the FDA review is complete. The post should provide context for the achievement that is helpful for making newcomers to the use of R in FDA submissions comfortable. For example, multiple R packages were deliberately used in the Pilots in order to signal that there is no one correct way to do things.</p>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h2>
<section id="webassembly" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webassembly">WebAssembly</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz reported on a number of updates to the Pilot 4 WebAssembly submission package.</p>
<ul>
<li>To take advantage of the new behavior of v0.2.0 of the Shinylive package: “…when exporting an app with the Shinylive R package, or using the Quarto extension, R packages dependencies will be frozen and bundled with your app as a private #wasm package library.”</li>
<li>We have been using R v4.2.3 in the Pilot 4 submission, however because WebAssembly defaults to R v4.2.1 we have switched to this version to maintain consistency. (This will be documented in the ADRG.)</li>
<li>Making the change above also means that both version of running Pilot 4, i.e either as a traditional Shiny app or a precompiled wasm bundle, will use the same versions of R packages.</li>
<li>The new version of the Shinylive app with WebAssembly has reduced the start up time for the Pilot 4 submissions package from over a minute to 15 seconds.</li>
<li>We will schedule Pilot 4 submission for a short time after the Pilot 3 clearance is complete.</li>
<li>Because of its large size, submitting the precompiled version of the WebAssembly transfer through the FDA gateway will require an extra step of downloading a zip archive into the transfer repo.</li>
<li>Eric is now testing on Windows 10.</li>
<li>Eric will debut the app in his talk a posit::conf.</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked about how he WebAssembly will be perceived within in FDA, Paul replied that it will depend on the use case and who gets involved.</p>

<section id="docker" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>Hye Soo has docker installed on her workstation, and will be able work with the Docker version of the Pilot 4 submission when it is ready.</p>

<section id="expanding-the-reach-of-the-r-working-group" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expanding-the-reach-of-the-r-working-group">Expanding the Reach of the R Working Group</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ning Leng proposed that it is time to expand the reach of the R Submissions working group to include clinicians and non data scientists.</li>
<li>She proposed blog posts and perhaps writing an academic paper noting the nature papers on
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2">Array programming with NumPy</a> and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00725-1">WebAssembly</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: The group will pursue writing a paper.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-licenses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-licenses">R Licenses</h2>
<p>There was a robust discussion about the impediment that the GPL licenses pose to the use of R that begins about 40 minutes into the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>JBR noted that company lawyers invariably seem to want to impose worst case measures when first encountering first encountering GPL licenses, and that if they do form an opinion about the limits of the license they are reticent to share their arguments publicly.</li>
<li>It was suggested that companies avoid using GPL packages</li>
<li>It was also noted that R ecosystem is mostly GPL based. An effort to track down the use of GPL licenses in packages and their dependencies included 72% of he CRAN ecosystem.</li>
<li>One apparent solution is to avoid bundling their code with GPL licensed packages, but to advise users that they should load the required GPL packages themselves.</li>
<li>The conversation settled on the notion of what is being shared, distinguishing between the code that produces tables and statistical results and code that modifies R in some way to profit from it.</li>
<li>Several members described how licensing seems to work within their companies.</li>
<li>An opinion that was offered that GPL 3 IS very “viral” but unless code was linking directly GPL2 is permissive.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.tibco.com/blog/2015/06/15/what-does-microsofts-acquisition-of-revolution-analytics-mean-for-the-r-language/">Tibco Blog post</a> from 2015 mentions how Microsoft was able to stay on the right side of GPL with its integration of Revolution Analytics code.</li>
<li>Also see this <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2240474/sql-server-2016-gets-an-r-language-rating.html">InfoWorld Article</a> by Sedar Yegulap from 2016 which states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The easy way to do so and still respect the terms of the GPL is via an “arm’s length” provision. Instead of integrating the R binaries directly into SQL Server, Microsoft could invoke the R software from its own executable as needed, then return results to the host application through a file or a data stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>They were able to install the Util package from the zip file and review the R programs to drive the ADaM data sets.</li>
<li>QC of the ADRG did turn up a minor issue regarding inconsistencies among three date variables.
<ul>
<li>The discussion of this issue begins at <strong>7:55</strong> in the video and is illustrated in the screen capture below.</li>
<li>The recommended solution is that the date origin should be specified in ISO 8601 date/time format in the ADRG.</li>
<li>Joel agreed to review the record of issues with Pilot 3 and see if there are any other parameters that ought to be explicitly mentioned in the ADRG.</li>

<ul>
<li>The end of June is still our target for the WebAssembly version of Pilot 4.</li>
<li>The plan is to do the container version at a later time after the WebAssembly version has been reviewed.</li>
<li>The question was asked if there are any special rules about package downloads.</li>
<li>Paul Schuette stated that downloading from CRAN is preferable, that in addition to the serialization FDA Security has mentioned downloads as a potential security problem, but that as far as he knows there are no regulations.</li>
<li>Eric pointed out that the Docker version of Pilot 4 also requires an image download.</li>
<li>Eric and Paul will meet to discuss this issue.</li>
<li>Eric will provide ADRG instructions and he and Paul will investigate,</li>

<section id="adrg" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adrg">ADRG</h2>
<p>There has been discussion within the working group as to whether we should investigate best practices for writing ADRGs for R based submissions. JBR noted that recent comments in issue #112 suggested that we should coordinated with the PHUSE ADRG working group. Discussion begins at <strong>29:00</strong> into the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>As it turned out Jane Owens (Eli Lilly) who is co-lead of the PHUSE ADRG working group was on the call.</li>
<li>PHUSE owns the ADRG templates</li>
<li>They are actively working on updating the templates with respect to R in section 7.1 of the template.</li>
<li>Pilot 3 has documentation on R packages in Section 7 and in an appendix to the ADRG (Section 9).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-06-07/ADRG.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li>PHUSE got its starting point for updating the ADRG for R from J&amp;J which Heidi Curinckx confirmed is based on J&amp;J’s participation in the Submissions WG.</li>
<li>The PHUSE WG will publish their updated template and then send it out for review</li>
<li>The Submissions WG and the PHUSE ADRG WG will cooperate and share information.</li>

<ul>
<li>The post has been revised to reelect the Submissions WG point of view and ends with a request for readers to comment in an issue that that we will open up on our GitHub repository.</li>
<li>The post includes paragraphs on how four companies Roche, Lilly, GSK, Pfizer deal internally with versioning and package management issues</li>
<li>Unfortunately, we must remove the quote from Paul because including it would require FDA approval.</li>
<li>Will also remove the FDA logo.</li>

<ul>
<li>The working group spent a few moments discussing the recently raveled vulnerability in R as reported in <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/r-programming-language-exposes-orgs-to-supply-chain-risk">Dark Reading</a> and <a href="https://aitap.github.io/2024/05/02/unserialize.html">other online</a> sites and discussed in this <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@median_headroom/112361657419172154">infosec exchange</a>.</li>
<li>The working group that the incident highlights the need for caution in accepting serialized objects just as one ought to be careful about clicking on any link from an untrusted source.</li>
<li>It was noted that our pilot submissions do not directly transmit data sets.</li>
<li>JBR noted that he has heard the R Foundation is working on an official statement about the incident and that the R Consortium will draw attention to it when it is available.</li>
<li>The working group agreed that the incident should be viewed as an “overdue wake up call” and.</li>
<li>JBR suggested that this might we a good time to see if we could attract R users with security expertise to the R Consortium.</li>
<li>Eric suggested Bob Rudis and and posted this <a href="https://rud.is/b/2024/05/03/cve-2024-27322-should-never-have-been-assigned-and-r-data-files-are-still-super-risky-even-in-r-4-4-0/?subscribe=success#subscribe-blog-blog_subscription-6">link</a> to a relevant post.</li>

<li>HyeSoo’s update begins at <strong>10 minutes, 30 seconds</strong> into the video</li>
<li>Her initial check did not reveal any major issues, but she did have a few minor issues mostly relating to the zip file and file names.</li>
<li>HyeSoo shared two solutions to the error depicted in the screen capture below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-05-03/p3error.png" class="img-fluid"> * There was also an inconsistency with a file name in the submission and the name in the ADRG. * A solution might be to rename the file after submission. * The FDA target date to wrap up the review is early July. * This would enable Ning to include the news the the useR! presentation.</p>

<p>Ben Staub provided an update on Pilot 3</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot 3 team is ready to make the resubmission.</li>
<li>The team will make the submission on Friday, April 12.</li>
<li>Ning will alert Bev at Roche who tests the gateway connection and makes the actual submission.</li>
<li>If all goes well, we expect the FDA could produce an evaluation report in late June or early July.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h2>
<p>Eric Nantz reported on the Plot 4 effort. (<strong>9:11</strong> into the video)</p>
<section id="wasam-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wasam-version">WASAM Version</h3>
<p>Eric asked for guidance on the placement of the zip file containing the application source files in the eCTD bundle. The WG decided that the placement indicated in the figure below looks fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-04-05/etcd.png" class="img-fluid"> The ADRG will provide instructions for running the application. The workflow will be something like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unzip the file</li>
<li>Execute the functions provided to compile the WASM application</li>
<li>Execute the functions provided to run the application. Two versions of execution functions will be provided:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Functions to execute with WASM</li>
<li>Functions to run a normal Shiny app as in Pilot 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>to continue zip files for M5, and not M#, even though this may throw a low level error.</li>
<li>to keep the datasets in a sub directory of the directory containing the WASM code without having to copy them into a another location before building the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>A question was asked about what persists on the workstation when the browser is closed. The answer was: not much persists on the machine. It may be the case that some information is cached but nothing is written to the disk.</p>
<p>A question was asked about having a short cut to launch the application. The answer is that in the current state of WebAssembly it is necessary to start a new R session (or other process) that can serve static files.</p>
<p>Also note the the process that spins up WebAssebly installs the required R packages. Unfortunately, with the current state of the technology there is no way to snapshot the versions of the packages.</p>
</section>
<section id="container-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="container-version">Container Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>A major development at the FDA is that FDA IT rejected the request to use Podman, but recommended that we use Docker.</li>
<li>Eric will include instructions in the ADRG to setup and run Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="communication-and-documentation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communication-and-documentation">Communication and Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Joe pointed out the infrastructure developed by the Submissions working group is significant and complex and that it is difficult to explain. He asked if we should undertake an effort to expand the website to include materials to explain the processes and technology to newcomers and document the history of what has been done.</li>
<li>Ning suggested that we follow the lead of the R Valid Hub and look for a communications manager or assemble a small team.</li>
<li>Eric noted that we have been focused on the submission itself and do not want to take on the challenge of how companies might establish their internal environments. All agreed with this.</li>
<li>Joe pointed out that the fact that Ning was chatting with Doug Kelkhoff is a good sign that there seems to be sufficient communication among the working groups to keep the working groups focused and avoid duplication.</li>
<li>Sam suggested putting a start here page and time line on the webpage. For example, see the <a href="https://insightsengineering.github.io/nest/">NEST Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>Eric noted that there might be a quarto extension to do a time line.</li>
<li>A suggestion was made to compile all of our presentation.</li>
<li>The WG will open an issue on the submission-wg repository to collect ideas</li>
<li>he <a href="https://r4csr.org/">R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission</a> website might serve as a model.</li>

<section id="recommended-r-versions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommended-r-versions">Recommended R Versions</h2>
<p>It turns out that making a recommendation for the version of R for companies to used in their submissions that would best harmonize with the versions that are likely to be in use at the FDA is much harder than we anticipated. Even our phrase for identifying our recommendation “Last patch version of the previous subversion” is not without ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is likely that each company will have its own approach to managing versions for submissions</li>
<li>Our new goal is to see if we can make an R Consortium recommendation that has sufficient industry support.</li>
<li>The FDA would like to avoid the extremes:
<ul>
<li>Submissions using very old R versions</li>
<li>Submissions using the latest R development version</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The FDA would also like to have submissions that are likely to still be available over a six year horizon. (FDA retention rules are six years.)</li>
<li>Ning proposed a series of posts from different companies on how they deal with versioning.</li>
<li>After we have published a few posts we will survey the industry.</li>
</ul>
<section id="action" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="action"><strong>Action</strong></h4>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plot-3-update">Plot 3 Update</h2>
<section id="fda-recommendation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fda-recommendation">FDA Recommendation</h3>
<p>HyeSoo stated that the FDA is considering issuing a recommendation that submissions sponsors should use the most recent patch version of the previous minor version of R.</p>
<p>For example, R versions are organized as V x.y.z where:</p>
<ul>
<li>x is the major version</li>
<li>y is the minor version or subversion</li>
<li>z is the patch version</li>
</ul>
<p>The WG members affirmed that a policy of using a proven stable version of R and not the latest version is in accordance with the practices of their respective companies.</p>
<p>After some thought the working group proposed that since patch versions are issued frequently (every couple of months), it might be better to have the FDA guidance suggest the last patch version of the previous subversion.</p>
<p>Note that the FDA is considering making a recommendation and not considering setting policy.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> JBR will confer with Sam, Paul and HyeSoo about the wording of the recommendation and then draft a blog post. The post will go to Paul, HyeSoo, Eric, and Ning for review before being published on the R Consortium Blog.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3-update">Pilot 3 Update</h2>
<p>HyeSoo and Joel informed the group that they met last month to resolve the discrepancy between the original CDISC version of the ADADAS ADaM data set and the Pilot 3 version of the ADaM data set. Joel noted that there are 818 available records in the QS domain. The CDISC ADADAS only brought in 799 records and imputed the rest, whereas Pilot 3 brought in all available 818 records into ADADAS and then imputed. When the Pilot 3 team adjusted by subsetting to ANL01FL=‘Y’ records first before doing the LOCF imputation the results matched Pilot 1 and the discrepancy was resolved. Look <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/pull/146">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>This issue illustrates the level of detail that the FDA must consider in replicating a sponsor’s submission environment. This particular issue was due to a statistical decision and not an error. Ning pointed out that most of the work in resolving discrepancies over the three Pilot submissions are due to insufficient documentation and inadequate communication and not to differences between SAS and R.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Ning and Joe will work on a blog post about this topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="rmedicine" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rmedicine">R/Medicine</h2>
<p>Joel has been invited to give a talk at the upcoming R/Medicine virtual conference which will be held from June 10 to 14. He is deciding whether to give a talk or a workshop.</p>
</section>
<section id="user-2024" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-2024">UseR! 2024</h2>
<p>The group decided to submit an abstract for useR!2024 which will be held from July 8 to 11 in Salzburg, Austria. the deadline for the CFP is Sunday, 10 March at 11:59 PM CET (UTC+1)</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<p>Eric and Ning will draft the abstract.</p>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4-update">Pilot 4 update</h2>
<p>At <strong>38:38</strong> into the video of the meeting, Eric previews the Pilot 4 WebAssembly (Wasm) submission. To be compatible with Wasm, the submission is being built with the <a href="https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/">Rhino</a> framework for shiny which is different from what was used in Pilot 2 but is functionally equivalent. The screen capture below references the compiling the <code>WebR</code> Wasm submission with <code>shinylive</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-03-01/pilot4.png" class="img-fluid"> After the build it is necessary to launch a webserver process on your your local setup. The Wasm version of the Shiny app reproduces the <code>teal</code> filters without using teal itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-03-01/KM.png" class="img-fluid"> The next step is to test the application on the container approximating the FDA Windows environment.</p>
<section id="immediate-plans" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="immediate-plans">Immediate Plans</h3>
<p>Joel’s team will continue working on Pilot 3 re-submission with the goal of picking a submission date at the April meeting.</p>

<section id="the-submission-environmnt-setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-submission-environmnt-setup">The Submission Environmnt Setup</h2>
<p>Setting up the submission environment is a manual process. The WG would like to automate at lest some of this process to ease the burden of setup and improve repeatability. It would be nice to have a GitHub action workflow that uses containers and runs on Azure. This will be a topic for the next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> JBR will promote this task and try to find a company willing to work on it.</p>
</section>
<section id="swissmedic-wg" class="level2">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h2>
<p>Hye Soo Cho presented a summary of the findings of the from the FDA review</p>
<ul>
<li>Different versions of R and RStudio
<ul>
<li>There were issues switching between R versions</li>
<li>The FDA would like the wg to explore the impact of different versions of R,RStudio and RTools</li>
<li>Also Linux vs.&nbsp;Windows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Differences between generated Pilot 2 ADaM and CDISC data sets
<ul>
<li>attributes</li>
<li>types (e.g.&nbsp;integer vs.&nbsp;double)</li>
<li>NA vs.&nbsp;NULL</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Package and file names
<ul>
<li>Incorrect package name (pilot3utils)</li>
<li>File name change (Pilot 3.xlsx to adam-pilot-3.xlsx)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>File path
<ul>
<li>The location of a director was specified using relative file path</li>
<li>Recommendation: use full path name</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Different primary output in Pilot 1 and Pilot 3
<ul>
<li>There are discrepancies between Pilot 3 ADaM and CDISC datasets</li>
<li>Discrepancies are noted in QC findings in ADRG</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There was considerable discussion about the challenges of dealing with different R versions and establishing a Windows test environment to test a submission before transmitting it to the FDA.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of setting up a gold standard windows test environment was considered but reject as beginning impractical. The actual FDA environment changes frequently because of hot fixes addressing security concerns.</li>
<li>It appears that the most practical path forward as to what preemptive measures sponsors can take to match submission environments with the FDA test environment is to work with the FDA to lock down the environment as best as can be done just prior to submission.</li>
<li>An interesting note: Paul mentioned that the FDA no longer pushes the idea of last observation carried forward for imputations. They favor exploring multiple imputation methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The FDA will consider the implications of what was discussed today and decide if we are ready to resubmit Pilot 3 by the next meeting in March. The submission will use the .zip approach.</li>
<li>Joel agreed to speak with Eric about establishing an automated way to set up a container running a “vanilla” Windows test environment. <strong>Note:</strong> in a series of private email conversations after the meeting Robert Devine volunteered his expertise to work with Eric and Joel to set up the windows environment.</li>

<p>On January 30, Gregory Chen presented the activities of our working group in person to an audience 15 people at the <a href="https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home.html">swissmedic</a> regulatory agency and 50 people online. Gregory’s slides are in the <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/tree/main/_Documents">github repository</a>. He summarized the discussion that took place after his presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The swissmedic audience was very interested in the use of Shiny for the Pilot 2 submission and would like to work with the R Consortium to explore the possibility of doing something similar at swissmedic. They discussed two possible ways to proceed:
<ol type="1">
<li>A Pilot 2 like project</li>
<li>Having sponsors set up a cloud environment</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The swissmedic audience said that they would prefer an industry collaborative effort rather than a vendor specific solution.</li>
<li>The were interested in learning about the resources the FDA allocated to the Pilot 2 and * asked about creating Shiny applications for market authorization.</li>
<li>The WG was excited about the possibility of collaborating with swissmedic</li>
<li>However, after some discussion it was decided that this opportunity should be pursued by a new working group devoted to swissmedic.</li>
<li>We should also find out if swissmedic has discussed these ideas with the EMA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JBR will work figure out how best to recruit members for a new working group focused on swissmedic.</li>
<li>This should include a call to the industry to identify people with European connections who could lead this effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM PST on Friday, March 1, 2024,</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-for-gregorys-presentation">Abstract for Gregory’s Presentation</h3>
<p><u>Name of presenter</u>: Gregory Chen</p>
<p><u>Affiliation</u>: MSD, Switzerland; R Submission Working group (R Consortium)</p>
<p><u>Brief introduction of the working group</u>:</p>
<p>The R submission working group is a cross-industry working group in pharma, focusing on improving practices of R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions. Our mission is to make R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions easier today and tomorrow by</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>showing open examples of using current submission portals,</p></li>
<li><p>collecting feedback and influencing future industry and agency decisions on system/process setup</p></li>
</ol>
<p><u>Title</u>: R and Shiny in regulatory submission</p>
<p><u>Abstract</u>:</p>
<p>In recent years, statisticians and analysts from both industry and regulatory agencies have increased adoption of open-source software such as R. Compared to other statistical programming languages, R brought great benefit from its vibrant open-source community, providing a wealth of cutting-edge statistical tools and adaptability to the latest data science trends. Particularly, R shiny provided great flexibility and interactivity to increase data scientists productivity and make it easier to extract insights or review through massive statistical outputs.&nbsp;To test the concept that R language and shiny app can be bundled into a submission package and transferred successfully to FDA reviewers, the R Submission Working group (R Consortium) successfully completed two pilot submissions to FDA fully in R, and received CDER response letters (<a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/12/08/successful-r-based-test-package-submitted-to-fda">pilot 1,</a> <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/10/05/shiny-app-successfully-reviewed-by-fda-cder-staff-pilot-2-announcement-2">pilot 2</a>). To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available submission packages that include components of open-source languages. In this talk, we will introduce R consortium, particularly its Submission Working group, and the completed pilot 1 and 2.</p>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h2>
<p>HyeSoo presented an update on the continuing FDA evaluation of Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using the R generated ADaM data sets, the FDA reviewers were able to replicate the results of the demographic, efficacy, primary and KM plot analyses</p></li>
<li><p>The reviewers compared the results of the four analyses between Pilot 1 and Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary output in Pilot 3 was different from the Pilot 1 result due to the QC findings</li>
<li>QC findings in ADRG include all of the discrepancies between the original ADaM datasets</li>
<li>The discrepancies in ADADAS data sets cause different primary analyses outputs</li>
<li>This is an issue from the CDISC ADADAS</li>
<li>It is not clear which CDISC file, the file from Pilot 1 or the file from Pilot 3, is correct.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure compares the Pilot 1 and Pilot 3 primary output. Discrepancies are highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-01-05/output_compare.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Comparison of Primary outputs"> Additional FDA questions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there an indication in the output of LOCF, “Last observation carried forward” when the original data set had no missing data?</li>
<li>There was no statistical analysis plan included in the submission.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Ben Straub will confer with the Pilot 3 team to answer these questions and review the discrepancy problems between Pilots 1 and 3.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Paul and HyeSoo will discuss whether we need to resubmit Pilot 3 The next meeting of the working group will be on Friday, February 2, 2024 at 9AM Pacific Time.</li>
<li>All agreed that if a resubmission of Pilot 3 is required, we will consider submitting via a .zip file.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was some discussion about what we could do to improve the quality control of our submissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The group agreed that we should have a check list to compare items against a Pilot 1 source of truth.</li>
<li>We should have additional reviewers who are not close to the work.</li>
<li>The idea of using AI tools to check consistency was mentioned.</li>
</ul>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>YounKyeong Chang of the FDA provided and update on he ongoing FDA review.</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to generate identical data sets with the code provided, but there were some minor corrections and issues.</li>
<li>Incorrect folder name in adlvc.r</li>
<li>After switching to R.4.2.3, code in ADRG installed pilotutils package instead of pilot3 package. Switching to from R 4.3.1 to R 4.2.3 resolved the problem.</li>
<li>There was an extensive discussion about missing values.</li>
<li>The CDISC standard indicates missing values with blanks, and depending on the variable type SAS may also use blanks for missing values. However, R encodes missing values as “NA”.</li>
<li>Decision made to convert missing values to NA when using R, but provide an option to use blanks for analysts using SAS. However, the FDA does not yet have an SOP for this.</li>
<li>A paragraph will be added to the ADRG to explain that SAS users should convert NAs to blanks.</li>
<li>The ADaM datasets in Pilot 3 where run through <a href="https://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2019/DS/PharmaSUG-2019-DS-119.pdf">Pinnacle 21</a> without error.</li>
<li>the WG should reach out to CDISC to see if they will modify their standard to accommodate R.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Ning and Joel will prepare a statement to communicate with CDISC.</li>
<li>Sharing of the details of any FDA findings, such as as those discussed in the meeting, require clearance</li>
<li>Some minor differences were observed in how SAS and R interpreted data types.</li>
<li>The FDA will try to evaluate the submission outputs by next month’s meeting</li>
<li>The WG agreed that after the evaluation of Pilot 3 is completed, it would be interesting to do a Pilot 3B submission using .zip instead of <code>pkglite</code> as was used in Pilots 1 and 2. Paul said that in light of the FDA requirement to keep submission materials for 6 years this would provide an alternative for long term preservation of the submission materials.</li>
<li>The FDA will make a decision whether an additional Pilot 3 submission to correct the problems identified so far is necessary after they have completed their evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provide a status update on Pilot 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot 4 will take the approach of submitting as a .zip archive.</li>
<li>An issue is that the default behavior of <code>WebR</code> is to install a special version of some commonly used R packages that are optimized for <code>WebR</code>.</li>
<li>We would like to include these special <code>WebR</code> binaries in the submission bundle in order to improve performance.</li>
<li>Because the binaries are not executable without a WebAssembly process running, the WG believes these binaries wold not violate the FDA requirement of not including executables.</li>
</ul>

<section id="events" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="events">Events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric, Hyesoo, and Paul will be presenting on December 11 in a Webinar that will be broadcast within the FDA as well as available to the public. Ning will lead a panel discussion afterwards.</li>
<li>The webinar <em>The use of R in Japan’s Pharma Industry</em> is scheduled for January 8, 2024.</li>
<li>Gregory Chen will be presenting the WGs work in person at Department of Clinical Assessment for Market Authorization at Swiss medic in January</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>HeySoo and Paul provide some preliminary comments regarding their evaluation of Pilot 3. An extensive discussion starts approximately 12 minutes into the video recording.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ADRG states that Pilot 3 was uses R 4.2.3. However, FDA may test using different R versions. (i.e.&nbsp;one reviewer using Rv4.2.1 and other using Rv4.2.3). There are at least two kinds of workstations used by FDA reviewers. Reviewers with “scientific workstations” may have administrative privileges and be able to install R. Users on other “regulatory” workstations will most likely use the version of R installed by IT.</li>
<li>The Pilot 3 package didn’t install using renv::install() when using Rv4.2.1, but did install when the reviewer was using Rv4.2.3.</li>
<li>The submissions programs which process ADaM data were not updated to match the file adam-pilot-3.xlsx which was included in the submission.</li>
<li>Reviewers were able to update the file name. When they did so the adsl.r ran fine.</li>
<li>Do not include notes to change the path to source data file in the ADRG steps. Instead, keep a note open to advise reviewers that they “should change the source data path to the location where the data was downloaded from the EDR”.</li>
<li>The submission documentation should include the version of the Microsoft operating system used along with the the version of the RStudio IDE used.</li>
<li>Sponsors using proprietary software also encounter Operating system issues. There may also be issues with respect to a difference in the size and power of the computers used by the sponsors and those available to the FDA reviewers.</li>
<li>There may be problems if file names using upper case letters are used in submissions. The FDA technical conformance guide specifies the use of lower case letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be held at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, December 8, 2023.</p>

<li>JBR began the meeting by noting the successful conclusion of the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/10/05/shiny-app-successfully-reviewed-by-fda-cder-staff-pilot-2-announcement-2">Pilot 2 submission</a> and commenting on the attention it is getting throughout the industry.</li>
<li>The group thanked Paul and HyeSoo for there work on the project and their efforts to shepherd the review through the FDA process.</li>
<li>Ning remarked that it was really helpful that Paul was able to provide us with the FDA letter for the ASA conference.</li>
<li>Ning and Eric talked about the how much attention their poster got at the conference.</li>
<li>The working group is enthusiastic about doing an R Consortium webinar about the Pilot 2 project.</li>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo laid out a timeline for evaluating Pilot 3, saying it would take an additional six to seven months to complete.</li>
<li>Ben said that there is quite a bit of interest at GSK about the ADRG because Pilot 3 did not use pkglite.</li>
<li>HyeSoo remarked that the ADRG is different but that her preliminary look did not show any problems.</li>
<li>There was some discussion abut looking back at the ADRGs made for both Pilot 2 and Pilot 3.</li>
<li>Eric noted that he made the Pilot 2 ADRG in Quarto and was very happy with the workflow.</li>
<li>We can expect feedback on the review during our normal sessions.</li>
<li>Ben Staub noted that Novo Nordisk about presentation about their recent R submission.</li>
<li>Paul remarked that he cannot comment on the Novo Nordisk submission since it is not finalized, but he did say that what Novo Nordisk said in their presentation about keeping things simple (limiting packages and dependencies) and being able to trace key endpoints is the same advice the FDA would be give.</li>
<li>Paul also noted that the fact that the FDA is not able to comment on submissions in progress is one reason why it is nice to have a pilot.</li>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric reported that he had the opportunity with meet with the Appsilon folks helping with Pilot 4 at posit::conf and that next sprint on the project will begin this coming week.</li>
<li>JBR brought up on several limitations to WebAssembly, such as not being able to accommodate networking functions in the browser.</li>
<li>Eric replied that Pilot 4 is not likely to hit the constraining limits, but that these may become a concern as we move into more robust submissions in 2024. (This discussion begins about 21:00 in the video)</li>
<li>JBR asks that we take the trouble to communicate clearly about our knowledge of the limitations.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about whether the FDA would be ready to receive a container based sub-submission.</li>
<li>The agreed that Pilot 4 in two parts: part a will be WebAssembly based and part b sill be based on containers.</li>
<li>Eric believes that he will be ready to submit Part 4.a in mid December. Paul will confer with his management about resources being available in that time frame.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about whether setting up a server with containers outside of the FDA would we be helpful for FDA reviewers becoming familiar with Podman.</li>
<li>JBR remarked that other working groups are interested in establishing protocols, best practices, and requirements for repositories.</li>
<li>Paul noted that from the FDA’s point of view, longevity should be a requirement noting that 6 years would be a minimum and there may be reasons to consider 20 years.</li>
<li>The group decided that it would be feasible and may be helpful to set up a server with the Pilot 2 submission shiny app running in a container.</li>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provided a status up date on Pilot 4 describing the significant progress that has been made with developing prototypes for both the WebAssemply and Container approaches.</p>
<section id="webassembly" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webassembly">WebAssembly</h4>
<ul>
<li>At 19:48 minutes in to the video Eric displays the Pilot 4 teams minutes for their recent meeting, <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot4/minutes/2023-08-18/">Minutes 2023-08-18</a>, and talks through the activities.</li>
<li>George Stagg and Winston Chang from Posit attended the Pilot 4 meeting</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=httpuv">httpuv</a> R package will be necessary to start up a mini web server in the user’s local environment. There will be a script to accomplish this.</li>
<li>There will be no traces of the Shiny app interacting with the host system</li>
<li>Binaries of the packages used will be included in the transfer. These will not be executable binaries. They will be similar to .tar or .zip files.</li>
<li>The end user will have to install the version of R used in Pilot 1</li>
<li><a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html">Shinylive</a> is another rapidly developing technology that may per pertinent to Pilot 4. Currently Shinylive is only available for Python. However, Winston Chang expects the R based version will be available soon.</li>
<li>Eric demos Shinylive from the posit website at 28:00 minutes into the video</li>
<li>See the Posit post <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/08/webr-0-2-0/">webR 0.2.0</a> for additional information.</li>
<li>A Pilot 4 submission based on WebAssembly technology looks feasible by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="containers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="containers">Containers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eric’s team already has a Podman container with Pilot 2 running</li>
<li>The team is waiting for Paul to clarify what is required by the FDA IT team for them be able to receive containers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preferred-technology" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preferred-technology">Preferred technology</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the WebAssembly version does not require the involvement of FDA technology, it looks like it is the preferred method for a first Pilot 4 submission</li>
<li>At 37:43 minutes into the video, Eric shows the “Hello World” version of a WebAssembly submission created by Appsilon engineers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="promotion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="promotion">Promotion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Rickert suggests that the story of the Submissions group cooperative effort is as important as the story of the technology.</li>
<li>The story of the overall submission group should be written up, However, Joe proposed that since the Pilot 4 effort is moving so quickly and involves contributions not only from working group members, but also from vendors we should tell this story first while the details are fresh.</li>
<li>Eric agrees that the participation of the two development teams from Posit and Appsilon is unique.</li>
<li>Eric notes that he has submitted a talk about Pilot 4 for the R/Pharma conference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eric and Ning will update the GitHub sites for the Pilot teams to make sure the information is up to date and all the contributors are recognized.</li>

<li>HyeSoo Cho reported that she is working with the Pilot 2 re-submission and that it looks good.</li>
<li>HyeSoo expects that the final on this pilot submission will be available at the end of August.</li>
<li>Everyone recognized and thanked Eric Nantz for the sustained and last-minute efforts to get the submission out.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paul Schuette brought the attention of the group to section 4.i.2.10 of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/study-data-technical-conformance-guide-technical-specifications-document">Study Data Technical Conformance Guide - Technical Specification Document</a> and noted that .r and .zip files are listed as acceptable file formats for submissions.</li>
<li>After some discussion, the WG decided not to use <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkglite">pkglite</a> to wrap the R code as has been done in previous submissions, but to use .r files for the code. (Note that the FDA is unable to use .R internally.)</li>
<li>Paul noted that the FDA desires submission materials to be applicable for at least six years after submission. This triggered a discussion about possibility of using .zip files to transmit the proprietary packages, instead of pulling them from public GitHub repos as been done so far.</li>
<li>In the end, the WG decided to stick with using GitHub repos for Pilot 3 as there is currently no apparent advantage testing the .zip file method at this time.</li>
<li>Joel Laxama reported that preparations for Pilot 3 are going well, and that a submission using .r files could be made in early September.</li>
<li>The WG thought it best to wait for the report of Pilot 2 before submitting Pilot 3.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric reported that thanks to the contributions form the <a href="https://appsilon.com/">Appsilon</a> team significant progress has been made on using both mechanisms for packaging R submissions: Containers and <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly</a>.</li>
<li>Appsilon has a prototype submission using <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> container technology working and has confirmed that it does not cause files to be written to the hard-drive.</li>
<li>Eric and the Appsilon engineers also have a very preliminary prototype of using Webassembly to wrap a small Shiny app working.</li>
<li>Posit engineers have contributed <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=webr">webr</a> expertise.</li>
<li>Eric is optimistic about having Pilot submissions based on at least one, and possibly both, of these technologies ready by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paul will confer with the proper FDA authorities to determine what preparations need to be undertaken by the FDA to use the Podman containers.</li>
<li>Eric will invite an Appsilon representative to come to a future meeting of this working group</li>

<li>Paul will be presenting at both at the <a href="https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70778947">PHUSE/FDA CSS 2023</a> conference on September 18 -20 and the <a href="https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70778947">ASA Biopharmaaceutical Section Regulatory-Industry statistics Workshop</a> to be held in Rockville, MD on September 27 - 29 and intends to use the activities of this working group as a case study.</li>
<li>Ning suggests that it would be very nice if the RC could hold and R Adoption Webinar in the November time frame to describe the Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paul will check with FDA authorities to see whether it is appropriate for the R Consortium to publicize his speaking opportunities on social media.</li>
<li>JBR will work with the RC Community development committee to make preparations for the promoting the speaking activities and setting up the webinar.</li>

<p>Eric Nantz has made progress on addressing the issues identified with the Pilot 2 resubmission. Fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-friendly warnings when filters result in an empty data set</li>
<li>Consistent footer and header notes in the tables titles that match the Pilot 1 output</li>
</ul>
<p>The only outstanding issue that is still being worked on is the warning message that results from loading the <code>teal</code> package from GitHub because it is not yet on CRAN.</p>
<p>The Pilot 2 resubmission is now scheduled for 9AM PST on Wednesday July 19, 2023. Note that shortly after the meeting the date was confirmed with Beverly Chin and HyeSoo Cho.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong> JBR to schedule a zoom meeting and invite:</p>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo Cho</li>
<li>Beverly Chin</li>
<li>Ning Leng</li>
<li>Eric Nantz</li>
</ul>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>Joel Laxamana provide the status update on Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot 3 team is developing the testing process and updating the ADRG to follow the process used in Pilots 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Developing the testing process is taking longer than expected because they are attempting to develop a hybrid of the different process used in Pilot 1 and Pilot 2.</li>
<li>The group is now targeting the first or second week of August for the Pilot 3 submission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joel will confer with Eric and Nan at a separate meeting.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric began the status update by thanking the team members from Appsilon who have set up a robust container environment for the Pilot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saghir has been able to get the container and app running in his environment</li>
<li>We must work with the FDA to determine the best method of transferring the container</li>
<li>Team members from Posit are working with the the WebAssembly</li>
<li>The major technical requirement is that the FDA reviewers will be able to run the <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> container environment</li>
<li>Right now, we believe that the WebAssembly, if it works as advertised, would be preferred by the FDA</li>
<li>It was noted that that FDA primarily works in a Windows environment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JBR to discuss FDA constraints and preferences with Paul Schuette.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM PST on Friday, August 4, 2023</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<p>JBR brought the meeting to order and Paul Schuette gave an account FDA analyst HyeSoo Cho’s findings so far with respect to the Pilot 2 submission. Identified problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning messages about packages being loaded from GitHub. (Packages should be loaded from CRAN or some other curated repository which archives packages.)</li>
<li>Footnotes and reference numbers that appeared in the previous Pilot 2 submission were missing from some tables.</li>
<li>Instead of remaining unchanged, some p-values were replaced with the text “non applicable” when filters were applied to the KM curve.</li>
<li>It is possible to create an empty data set with conflicting filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although all agreed that these were relatively minor problems, it was nevertheless agreed that we should ask Hye Soo to stop her review, while Eric Nantz fixes the problems. The end goal is to have Pilot 2 be as clean as possible to serve as a model for future work.</p>
<p>The new schedule is to arrange for a new Pilot 2 Submission by the end of June. We will arrange for a new submission date when Eric is ready.</p>

<li>Engineers from Appsilon will join the Pilot 4 team. They are particularly interested in investigating the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> technology and have experience with containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, July 7, 2023.</p>

<section id="pilot-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hye Soo Cho of the FDA reported that her review of the Pilot 2 submission is going well and that she expects to be finished in June.</li>
<li>She is not sure how long it will take the FDA to produce a written response.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>Joel Laxamana reported on Pilot 3 work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The execution team isfocusing on documentation particularly in the ADRG.</li>
<li>The WG confirmed that Pilot 3 should follow the Pilot 2 approach and send the renv.lock file in the R package text.</li>
<li>There was a question about SDTM Versions. The WG confirmed that the Pilot 3 should use the same 1.4 STDM version as Pilots 1 and 2. See <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/104">Issue #104</a>.</li>
<li>QC Findings will go as Appendix to the ADRG.</li>
<li>The WG agreed that the second week in July would be a good target for Pilot 3 Submission.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provided an update on Pilot 4 work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric expects to have the first meeting of the execution team volunteers in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Eric is taking a step back from committing to a container based approach in order to consider the possibility of using a self executing app in the browser using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>.</li>
<li>George Stagg from Posit is providing some assistance.</li>
<li>The idea is that the R submission code would run in a browser on the local machine of an FDA analyst.</li>
<li>Paul Schuette indicated that this approach would likely be possible at the FDA.</li>
<li>Eric said that he would be happy to try and replicate the FDA web browser environment.</li>
<li>The group suggested that a Webinar for the R Adoption series and other venues would be valuable for promoting the project.</li>
<li>Paul speculated that this web browser technology might also be useful to FDA field inspectors.</li>
<li>Eric noted that a selection core of R packages is being identified to have them run run “out of the box”.</li>
<li>If you would like to be part of the Pilot 4 team please contact Eric Nantz.</li>
<li>Paul noted that recent events where outside entities can re-litigate FDA approvals decades after the approval could make it even more necessary to be able to run analysis software many years after the submission.</li>
<li>JBR surmised that there may be interest in WG to explore long term archiving.</li>
</ul>

<section id="other-discussions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-discussions">Other discussions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nan Xiao brought attention to a <a href="https://www.jpma.or.jp/information/evaluation/results/allotment/DS_202204_oss.html">document</a> describing the submission WG in Japan. It refers to a survey about open source that mentions the Pilot 1 Submissions.</li>
<li>We are exploring the possibility of arranging for the authors of this document to participation in an R Adoption Series webinar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be on Friday, June 2, 2023 at 9AM Pacific Time.</p>
