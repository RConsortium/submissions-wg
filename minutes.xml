<p>The meeting was recorded and the <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/share/q1OxNGNb9yLXC8l5xAPyAdiIz9qBc5GG45Br9dVPvJAVrfpuiKWQSuNIY0QQpGSR.1wBN0XjiXC3BIVeb?startTime=1722614682000">video</a> is available.</p>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h2>
<p>Hye Soo reported that the Pilot 3 review has not yet been completed by he FDA authorities. There are no known problems. The delay is most likely due to a summer slowdown.</p>
<p>Before the meeting Joel Laxamana shared a list of recent and upcoming Pilot 3 related talks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>[Pilot 3 Demo : R/Medicine 2024](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_2024/Program.html)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPmNdHTVYm8&amp;list=PL77T87Q0eoJhsC203plZ1H4p21AGrM9rl&amp;index=12">Pilot 3 Demo : useR! 2024 On-line talk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2024-07-03_introducing_a_ne.../introducing_a_new_coursera_course_for_hands_on_clinical_data_science_using__r..html">Roche-Genentech Coursera training on ‘Hands on Clinical Reporting using R’</a></li>
<li>Joel will also be a part of a PHUSE WG project coming up. Yet to be started, but will share more details soon.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Acton</strong>: Ning will begin a draft blog post for Pilot 3 to be posted after the FDA review is complete. The post should provide context for the achievement that is helpful for making newcomers to the use of R in FDA submissions comfortable. For example, multiple R packages were deliberately used in the Pilots in order to signal that there is no one correct way to do things.</p>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h2>
<section id="webassembly" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webassembly">WebAssembly</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz reported on a number of updates to the Pilot 4 WebAssembly submission package.</p>
<ul>
<li>To take advantage of the new behavior of v0.2.0 of the Shinylive package: “…when exporting an app with the Shinylive R package, or using the Quarto extension, R packages dependencies will be frozen and bundled with your app as a private #wasm package library.”</li>
<li>We have been using R v4.2.3 in the Pilot 4 submission, however because WebAssembly defaults to R v4.2.1 we have switched to this version to maintain consistency. (This will be documented in the ADRG.)</li>
<li>Making the change above also means that both version of running Pilot 4, i.e either as a traditional Shiny app or a precompiled wasm bundle, will use the same versions of R packages.</li>
<li>The new version of the Shinylive app with WebAssembly has reduced the start up time for the Pilot 4 submissions package from over a minute to 15 seconds.</li>
<li>We will schedule Pilot 4 submission for a short time after the Pilot 3 clearance is complete.</li>
<li>Because of its large size, submitting the precompiled version of the WebAssembly transfer through the FDA gateway will require an extra step of downloading a zip archive into the transfer repo.</li>
<li>Eric is now testing on Windows 10.</li>
<li>Eric will debut the app in his talk a posit::conf.</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked about how he WebAssembly will be perceived within in FDA, Paul replied that it will depend on the use case and who gets involved.</p>
</section>
<section id="docker" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>Hye Soo has docker installed on her workstation, and will be able work with the Docker version of the Pilot 4 submission when it is ready.</p>

<section id="expanding-the-reach-of-the-r-working-group" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expanding-the-reach-of-the-r-working-group">Expanding the Reach of the R Working Group</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ning Leng proposed that it is time to expand the reach of the R Submissions working group to include clinicians and non data scientists.</li>
<li>She proposed blog posts and perhaps writing an academic paper noting the nature papers on
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2">Array programming with NumPy</a> and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00725-1">WebAssembly</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: The group will pursue writing a paper.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-licenses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-licenses">R Licenses</h2>
<p>There was a robust discussion about the impediment that the GPL licenses pose to the use of R that begins about 40 minutes into the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>JBR noted that company lawyers invariably seem to want to impose worst case measures when first encountering first encountering GPL licenses, and that if they do form an opinion about the limits of the license they are reticent to share their arguments publicly.</li>
<li>It was suggested that companies avoid using GPL packages</li>
<li>It was also noted that R ecosystem is mostly GPL based. An effort to track down the use of GPL licenses in packages and their dependencies included 72% of he CRAN ecosystem.</li>
<li>One apparent solution is to avoid bundling their code with GPL licensed packages, but to advise users that they should load the required GPL packages themselves.</li>
<li>The conversation settled on the notion of what is being shared, distinguishing between the code that produces tables and statistical results and code that modifies R in some way to profit from it.</li>
<li>Several members described how licensing seems to work within their companies.</li>
<li>An opinion that was offered that GPL 3 IS very “viral” but unless code was linking directly GPL2 is permissive.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.tibco.com/blog/2015/06/15/what-does-microsofts-acquisition-of-revolution-analytics-mean-for-the-r-language/">Tibco Blog post</a> from 2015 mentions how Microsoft was able to stay on the right side of GPL with its integration of Revolution Analytics code.</li>
<li>Also see this <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2240474/sql-server-2016-gets-an-r-language-rating.html">InfoWorld Article</a> by Sedar Yegulap from 2016 which states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The easy way to do so and still respect the terms of the GPL is via an “arm’s length” provision. Instead of integrating the R binaries directly into SQL Server, Microsoft could invoke the R software from its own executable as needed, then return results to the host application through a file or a data stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="next-meeting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-meeting">Next Meeting</h3>
<p>The next meeting of the R Submissions working group will be on Friday, September 6, 2024 at 9 AM Pacific Time.</p>

<li>They were able to install the Util package from the zip file and review the R programs to drive the ADaM data sets.</li>
<li>QC of the ADRG did turn up a minor issue regarding inconsistencies among three date variables.
<ul>
<li>The discussion of this issue begins at <strong>7:55</strong> in the video and is illustrated in the screen capture below.</li>
<li>The recommended solution is that the date origin should be specified in ISO 8601 date/time format in the ADRG.</li>
<li>Joel agreed to review the record of issues with Pilot 3 and see if there are any other parameters that ought to be explicitly mentioned in the ADRG.</li>

<p>Eric Nantz described progress on the Pilot 4 Submission.</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of June is still our target for the WebAssembly version of Pilot 4.</li>
<li>The plan is to do the container version at a later time after the WebAssembly version has been reviewed.</li>
<li>The question was asked if there are any special rules about package downloads.</li>
<li>Paul Schuette stated that downloading from CRAN is preferable, that in addition to the serialization FDA Security has mentioned downloads as a potential security problem, but that as far as he knows there are no regulations.</li>
<li>Eric pointed out that the Docker version of Pilot 4 also requires an image download.</li>
<li>Eric and Paul will meet to discuss this issue.</li>

<section id="adrg" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adrg">ADRG</h2>
<p>There has been discussion within the working group as to whether we should investigate best practices for writing ADRGs for R based submissions. JBR noted that recent comments in issue #112 suggested that we should coordinated with the PHUSE ADRG working group. Discussion begins at <strong>29:00</strong> into the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>As it turned out Jane Owens (Eli Lilly) who is co-lead of the PHUSE ADRG working group was on the call.</li>
<li>PHUSE owns the ADRG templates</li>
<li>They are actively working on updating the templates with respect to R in section 7.1 of the template.</li>
<li>Pilot 3 has documentation on R packages in Section 7 and in an appendix to the ADRG (Section 9).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-06-07/ADRG.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li>PHUSE got its starting point for updating the ADRG for R from J&amp;J which Heidi Curinckx confirmed is based on J&amp;J’s participation in the Submissions WG.</li>
<li>The PHUSE WG will publish their updated template and then send it out for review</li>
<li>The Submissions WG and the PHUSE ADRG WG will cooperate and share information.</li>
<li>JBR invited Jane and other members of her WG to attend future meetings.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="r-versions-blog-post" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-versions-blog-post">R Versions Blog Post</h2>
<p>A small group led my Ning Leng is working on a blog post aimed at generating consensus about what versions of R might be appropriate for R based submissions at any point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The post has been revised to reelect the Submissions WG point of view and ends with a request for readers to comment in an issue that that we will open up on our GitHub repository.</li>
<li>The post includes paragraphs on how four companies Roche, Lilly, GSK, Pfizer deal internally with versioning and package management issues</li>
<li>Unfortunately, we must remove the quote from Paul because including it would require FDA approval.</li>
<li>Will also remove the FDA logo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ning and the other authors will finalize the text.</li>
<li>JBR will send a MS word version of the post to Paul for final review.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Because the July meeting is scheduled on the US July 4th holiday weekend and because of travel to the useR! conference the July meeting will be cancelled. * The next meeting of the submissions WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday August 2, 2022.</li>

<section id="pilot-3-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3-update">Pilot 3 Update</h2>
<p>Ben Staub provided an update on Pilot 3</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot 3 team is ready to make the resubmission.</li>
<li>The team will make the submission on Friday, April 12.</li>
<li>Ning will alert Bev at Roche who tests the gateway connection and makes the actual submission.</li>
<li>If all goes well, we expect the FDA could produce an evaluation report in late June or early July.</li>
</ul>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h2>
<p>Eric Nantz reported on the Plot 4 effort. (<strong>9:11</strong> into the video)</p>
<section id="wasam-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wasam-version">WASAM Version</h3>
<p>Eric asked for guidance on the placement of the zip file containing the application source files in the eCTD bundle. The WG decided that the placement indicated in the figure below looks fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-04-05/etcd.png" class="img-fluid"> The ADRG will provide instructions for running the application. The workflow will be something like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unzip the file</li>
<li>Execute the functions provided to compile the WASM application</li>
<li>Execute the functions provided to run the application. Two versions of execution functions will be provided:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Functions to execute with WASM</li>
<li>Functions to run a normal Shiny app as in Pilot 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>to continue zip files for M5, and not M#, even though this may throw a low level error.</li>
<li>to keep the datasets in a sub directory of the directory containing the WASM code without having to copy them into a another location before building the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>A question was asked about what persists on the workstation when the browser is closed. The answer was: not much persists on the machine. It may be the case that some information is cached but nothing is written to the disk.</p>
<p>A question was asked about having a short cut to launch the application. The answer is that in the current state of WebAssembly it is necessary to start a new R session (or other process) that can serve static files.</p>
<p>Also note the the process that spins up WebAssebly installs the required R packages. Unfortunately, with the current state of the technology there is no way to snapshot the versions of the packages.</p>
</section>
<section id="container-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="container-version">Container Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>A major development at the FDA is that FDA IT rejected the request to use Podman, but recommended that we use Docker.</li>
<li>Eric will include instructions in the ADRG to setup and run Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="communication-and-documentation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communication-and-documentation">Communication and Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Joe pointed out the infrastructure developed by the Submissions working group is significant and complex and that it is difficult to explain. He asked if we should undertake an effort to expand the website to include materials to explain the processes and technology to newcomers and document the history of what has been done.</li>
<li>Ning suggested that we follow the lead of the R Valid Hub and look for a communications manager or assemble a small team.</li>
<li>Eric noted that we have been focused on the submission itself and do not want to take on the challenge of how companies might establish their internal environments. All agreed with this.</li>
<li>Joe pointed out that the fact that Ning was chatting with Doug Kelkhoff is a good sign that there seems to be sufficient communication among the working groups to keep the working groups focused and avoid duplication.</li>
<li>Sam suggested putting a start here page and time line on the webpage. For example, see the <a href="https://insightsengineering.github.io/nest/">NEST Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>Eric noted that there might be a quarto extension to do a time line.</li>
<li>A suggestion was made to compile all of our presentation.</li>
<li>The WG will open an issue on the submission-wg repository to collect ideas</li>
<li>he <a href="https://r4csr.org/">R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission</a> website might serve as a model.</li>
</ul>

<section id="recommended-r-versions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommended-r-versions">Recommended R Versions</h2>
<p>It turns out that making a recommendation for the version of R for companies to used in their submissions that would best harmonize with the versions that are likely to be in use at the FDA is much harder than we anticipated. Even our phrase for identifying our recommendation “Last patch version of the previous subversion” is not without ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is likely that each company will have its own approach to managing versions for submissions</li>
<li>Our new goal is to see if we can make an R Consortium recommendation that has sufficient industry support.</li>
<li>The FDA would like to avoid the extremes:
<ul>
<li>Submissions using very old R versions</li>
<li>Submissions using the latest R development version</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The FDA would also like to have submissions that are likely to still be available over a six year horizon. (FDA retention rules are six years.)</li>
<li>Ning proposed a series of posts from different companies on how they deal with versioning.</li>
<li>After we have published a few posts we will survey the industry.</li>
</ul>
<section id="action" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="action"><strong>Action</strong></h4>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plot-3-update">Plot 3 Update</h2>
<section id="fda-recommendation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fda-recommendation">FDA Recommendation</h3>
<p>HyeSoo stated that the FDA is considering issuing a recommendation that submissions sponsors should use the most recent patch version of the previous minor version of R.</p>
<p>For example, R versions are organized as V x.y.z where:</p>
<ul>
<li>x is the major version</li>
<li>y is the minor version or subversion</li>
<li>z is the patch version</li>
</ul>
<p>The WG members affirmed that a policy of using a proven stable version of R and not the latest version is in accordance with the practices of their respective companies.</p>
<p>After some thought the working group proposed that since patch versions are issued frequently (every couple of months), it might be better to have the FDA guidance suggest the last patch version of the previous subversion.</p>
<p>Note that the FDA is considering making a recommendation and not considering setting policy.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> JBR will confer with Sam, Paul and HyeSoo about the wording of the recommendation and then draft a blog post. The post will go to Paul, HyeSoo, Eric, and Ning for review before being published on the R Consortium Blog.</p>

<section id="pilot-3-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3-update">Pilot 3 Update</h2>
<p>HyeSoo and Joel informed the group that they met last month to resolve the discrepancy between the original CDISC version of the ADADAS ADaM data set and the Pilot 3 version of the ADaM data set. Joel noted that there are 818 available records in the QS domain. The CDISC ADADAS only brought in 799 records and imputed the rest, whereas Pilot 3 brought in all available 818 records into ADADAS and then imputed. When the Pilot 3 team adjusted by subsetting to ANL01FL=‘Y’ records first before doing the LOCF imputation the results matched Pilot 1 and the discrepancy was resolved. Look <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/pull/146">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>This issue illustrates the level of detail that the FDA must consider in replicating a sponsor’s submission environment. This particular issue was due to a statistical decision and not an error. Ning pointed out that most of the work in resolving discrepancies over the three Pilot submissions are due to insufficient documentation and inadequate communication and not to differences between SAS and R.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Ning and Joe will work on a blog post about this topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="rmedicine" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rmedicine">R/Medicine</h2>
<p>Joel has been invited to give a talk at the upcoming R/Medicine virtual conference which will be held from June 10 to 14. He is deciding whether to give a talk or a workshop.</p>
</section>
<section id="user-2024" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-2024">UseR! 2024</h2>
<p>The group decided to submit an abstract for useR!2024 which will be held from July 8 to 11 in Salzburg, Austria. the deadline for the CFP is Sunday, 10 March at 11:59 PM CET (UTC+1)</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<p>Eric and Ning will draft the abstract.</p>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4-update">Pilot 4 update</h2>
<p>At <strong>38:38</strong> into the video of the meeting, Eric previews the Pilot 4 WebAssembly (Wasm) submission. To be compatible with Wasm, the submission is being built with the <a href="https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/">Rhino</a> framework for shiny which is different from what was used in Pilot 2 but is functionally equivalent. The screen capture below references the compiling the <code>WebR</code> Wasm submission with <code>shinylive</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-03-01/pilot4.png" class="img-fluid"> After the build it is necessary to launch a webserver process on your your local setup. The Wasm version of the Shiny app reproduces the <code>teal</code> filters without using teal itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-03-01/KM.png" class="img-fluid"> The next step is to test the application on the container approximating the FDA Windows environment.</p>
<section id="immediate-plans" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="immediate-plans">Immediate Plans</h3>
<p>Joel’s team will continue working on Pilot 3 re-submission with the goal of picking a submission date at the April meeting.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-submission-environmnt-setup">The Submission Environmnt Setup</h2>
<p>Setting up the submission environment is a manual process. The WG would like to automate at lest some of this process to ease the burden of setup and improve repeatability. It would be nice to have a GitHub action workflow that uses containers and runs on Azure. This will be a topic for the next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> JBR will promote this task and try to find a company willing to work on it.</p>

<p>Hye Soo Cho presented a summary of the findings of the from the FDA review</p>
<ul>
<li>Different versions of R and RStudio
<ul>
<li>There were issues switching between R versions</li>
<li>The FDA would like the wg to explore the impact of different versions of R,RStudio and RTools</li>
<li>Also Linux vs.&nbsp;Windows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Differences between generated Pilot 2 ADaM and CDISC data sets
<ul>
<li>attributes</li>
<li>types (e.g.&nbsp;integer vs.&nbsp;double)</li>
<li>NA vs.&nbsp;NULL</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Package and file names
<ul>
<li>Incorrect package name (pilot3utils)</li>
<li>File name change (Pilot 3.xlsx to adam-pilot-3.xlsx)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>File path
<ul>
<li>The location of a director was specified using relative file path</li>
<li>Recommendation: use full path name</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Different primary output in Pilot 1 and Pilot 3
<ul>
<li>There are discrepancies between Pilot 3 ADaM and CDISC datasets</li>
<li>Discrepancies are noted in QC findings in ADRG</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There was considerable discussion about the challenges of dealing with different R versions and establishing a Windows test environment to test a submission before transmitting it to the FDA.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of setting up a gold standard windows test environment was considered but reject as beginning impractical. The actual FDA environment changes frequently because of hot fixes addressing security concerns.</li>
<li>It appears that the most practical path forward as to what preemptive measures sponsors can take to match submission environments with the FDA test environment is to work with the FDA to lock down the environment as best as can be done just prior to submission.</li>
<li>An interesting note: Paul mentioned that the FDA no longer pushes the idea of last observation carried forward for imputations. They favor exploring multiple imputation methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The FDA will consider the implications of what was discussed today and decide if we are ready to resubmit Pilot 3 by the next meeting in March. The submission will use the .zip approach.</li>
<li>Joel agreed to speak with Eric about establishing an automated way to set up a container running a “vanilla” Windows test environment. <strong>Note:</strong> in a series of private email conversations after the meeting Robert Devine volunteered his expertise to work with Eric and Joel to set up the windows environment.</li>

<p>On January 30, Gregory Chen presented the activities of our working group in person to an audience 15 people at the <a href="https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home.html">swissmedic</a> regulatory agency and 50 people online. Gregory’s slides are in the <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/tree/main/_Documents">github repository</a>. He summarized the discussion that took place after his presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The swissmedic audience was very interested in the use of Shiny for the Pilot 2 submission and would like to work with the R Consortium to explore the possibility of doing something similar at swissmedic. They discussed two possible ways to proceed:
<ol type="1">
<li>A Pilot 2 like project</li>
<li>Having sponsors set up a cloud environment</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The swissmedic audience said that they would prefer an industry collaborative effort rather than a vendor specific solution.</li>
<li>The were interested in learning about the resources the FDA allocated to the Pilot 2 and * asked about creating Shiny applications for market authorization.</li>
<li>The WG was excited about the possibility of collaborating with swissmedic</li>
<li>However, after some discussion it was decided that this opportunity should be pursued by a new working group devoted to swissmedic.</li>
<li>We should also find out if swissmedic has discussed these ideas with the EMA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JBR will work figure out how best to recruit members for a new working group focused on swissmedic.</li>

<p><u>Name of presenter</u>: Gregory Chen</p>
<p><u>Affiliation</u>: MSD, Switzerland; R Submission Working group (R Consortium)</p>
<p><u>Brief introduction of the working group</u>:</p>
<p>The R submission working group is a cross-industry working group in pharma, focusing on improving practices of R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions. Our mission is to make R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions easier today and tomorrow by</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>showing open examples of using current submission portals,</p></li>
<li><p>collecting feedback and influencing future industry and agency decisions on system/process setup</p></li>
</ol>
<p><u>Title</u>: R and Shiny in regulatory submission</p>
<p><u>Abstract</u>:</p>
<p>In recent years, statisticians and analysts from both industry and regulatory agencies have increased adoption of open-source software such as R. Compared to other statistical programming languages, R brought great benefit from its vibrant open-source community, providing a wealth of cutting-edge statistical tools and adaptability to the latest data science trends. Particularly, R shiny provided great flexibility and interactivity to increase data scientists productivity and make it easier to extract insights or review through massive statistical outputs.&nbsp;To test the concept that R language and shiny app can be bundled into a submission package and transferred successfully to FDA reviewers, the R Submission Working group (R Consortium) successfully completed two pilot submissions to FDA fully in R, and received CDER response letters (<a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/12/08/successful-r-based-test-package-submitted-to-fda">pilot 1,</a> <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/10/05/shiny-app-successfully-reviewed-by-fda-cder-staff-pilot-2-announcement-2">pilot 2</a>). To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available submission packages that include components of open-source languages. In this talk, we will introduce R consortium, particularly its Submission Working group, and the completed pilot 1 and 2.</p>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h2>
<p>HyeSoo presented an update on the continuing FDA evaluation of Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using the R generated ADaM data sets, the FDA reviewers were able to replicate the results of the demographic, efficacy, primary and KM plot analyses</p></li>
<li><p>The reviewers compared the results of the four analyses between Pilot 1 and Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary output in Pilot 3 was different from the Pilot 1 result due to the QC findings</li>
<li>QC findings in ADRG include all of the discrepancies between the original ADaM datasets</li>
<li>The discrepancies in ADADAS data sets cause different primary analyses outputs</li>
<li>This is an issue from the CDISC ADADAS</li>
<li>It is not clear which CDISC file, the file from Pilot 1 or the file from Pilot 3, is correct.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure compares the Pilot 1 and Pilot 3 primary output. Discrepancies are highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/minutes/2024-01-05/output_compare.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Comparison of Primary outputs"> Additional FDA questions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there an indication in the output of LOCF, “Last observation carried forward” when the original data set had no missing data?</li>
<li>There was no statistical analysis plan included in the submission.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Ben Straub will confer with the Pilot 3 team to answer these questions and review the discrepancy problems between Pilots 1 and 3.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Paul and HyeSoo will discuss whether we need to resubmit Pilot 3 The next meeting of the working group will be on Friday, February 2, 2024 at 9AM Pacific Time.</li>
<li>All agreed that if a resubmission of Pilot 3 is required, we will consider submitting via a .zip file.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was some discussion about what we could do to improve the quality control of our submissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The group agreed that we should have a check list to compare items against a Pilot 1 source of truth.</li>
<li>We should have additional reviewers who are not close to the work.</li>
<li>The idea of using AI tools to check consistency was mentioned.</li>
</ul>

<p>JBR began the meeting the meeting with a reminder that the meeting is to be conducted in compliance with the Antitrust laws.</p>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>YounKyeong Chang of the FDA provided and update on he ongoing FDA review.</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to generate identical data sets with the code provided, but there were some minor corrections and issues.</li>
<li>Incorrect folder name in adlvc.r</li>
<li>After switching to R.4.2.3, code in ADRG installed pilotutils package instead of pilot3 package. Switching to from R 4.3.1 to R 4.2.3 resolved the problem.</li>
<li>There was an extensive discussion about missing values.</li>
<li>The CDISC standard indicates missing values with blanks, and depending on the variable type SAS may also use blanks for missing values. However, R encodes missing values as “NA”.</li>
<li>Decision made to convert missing values to NA when using R, but provide an option to use blanks for analysts using SAS. However, the FDA does not yet have an SOP for this.</li>
<li>A paragraph will be added to the ADRG to explain that SAS users should convert NAs to blanks.</li>
<li>The ADaM datasets in Pilot 3 where run through <a href="https://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2019/DS/PharmaSUG-2019-DS-119.pdf">Pinnacle 21</a> without error.</li>
<li>the WG should reach out to CDISC to see if they will modify their standard to accommodate R.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong> Ning and Joel will prepare a statement to communicate with CDISC.</li>
<li>Sharing of the details of any FDA findings, such as as those discussed in the meeting, require clearance</li>
<li>Some minor differences were observed in how SAS and R interpreted data types.</li>
<li>The FDA will try to evaluate the submission outputs by next month’s meeting</li>
<li>The WG agreed that after the evaluation of Pilot 3 is completed, it would be interesting to do a Pilot 3B submission using .zip instead of <code>pkglite</code> as was used in Pilots 1 and 2. Paul said that in light of the FDA requirement to keep submission materials for 6 years this would provide an alternative for long term preservation of the submission materials.</li>
<li>The FDA will make a decision whether an additional Pilot 3 submission to correct the problems identified so far is necessary after they have completed their evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provide a status update on Pilot 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot 4 will take the approach of submitting as a .zip archive.</li>
<li>An issue is that the default behavior of <code>WebR</code> is to install a special version of some commonly used R packages that are optimized for <code>WebR</code>.</li>
<li>We would like to include these special <code>WebR</code> binaries in the submission bundle in order to improve performance.</li>
<li>Because the binaries are not executable without a WebAssembly process running, the WG believes these binaries wold not violate the FDA requirement of not including executables.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="events" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="events">Events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric, Hyesoo, and Paul will be presenting on December 11 in a Webinar that will be broadcast within the FDA as well as available to the public. Ning will lead a panel discussion afterwards.</li>
<li>The webinar <em>The use of R in Japan’s Pharma Industry</em> is scheduled for January 8, 2024.</li>
<li>Gregory Chen will be presenting the WGs work in person at Department of Clinical Assessment for Market Authorization at Swiss medic in January</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting will take place at 9AM St on Friday, January 5, 2025. <strong>Action:</strong> JBR will issue a new set of calendar invitations for 2024. Stay tuned for details.</p>

<section id="fdasa-presentation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fdasa-presentation">FDASA Presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The FDASA would like to invite the R Consortium to present at their meeting on December 11, 2023 (3 to 4:30PM ET).</li>
<li>However the FDASA would like to extend an informal invitation rather than formally sponsor the event which would require administrative approvals</li>
<li>The RC would still be able to advertise that Paul and HyeSoo are speaking</li>
<li>The RC would conduct the event which is expected to attract at least 200 of the approximately 400 FDASA participants.</li>
<li>Registration of the event is not required</li>
<li>The RC can also invite the general public to attend. (JBR will confer with Ning and Eric about doing this.)</li>
<li>JBR will s=send an invitation to the event, which should include the abstract, to Paul to be used to invite FDASA members to the event through internal channels.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>HeySoo and Paul provide some preliminary comments regarding their evaluation of Pilot 3. An extensive discussion starts approximately 12 minutes into the video recording.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ADRG states that Pilot 3 was uses R 4.2.3. However, FDA may test using different R versions. (i.e.&nbsp;one reviewer using Rv4.2.1 and other using Rv4.2.3). There are at least two kinds of workstations used by FDA reviewers. Reviewers with “scientific workstations” may have administrative privileges and be able to install R. Users on other “regulatory” workstations will most likely use the version of R installed by IT.</li>
<li>The Pilot 3 package didn’t install using renv::install() when using Rv4.2.1, but did install when the reviewer was using Rv4.2.3.</li>
<li>The submissions programs which process ADaM data were not updated to match the file adam-pilot-3.xlsx which was included in the submission.</li>
<li>Reviewers were able to update the file name. When they did so the adsl.r ran fine.</li>
<li>Do not include notes to change the path to source data file in the ADRG steps. Instead, keep a note open to advise reviewers that they “should change the source data path to the location where the data was downloaded from the EDR”.</li>
<li>The submission documentation should include the version of the Microsoft operating system used along with the the version of the RStudio IDE used.</li>
<li>Sponsors using proprietary software also encounter Operating system issues. There may also be issues with respect to a difference in the size and power of the computers used by the sponsors and those available to the FDA reviewers.</li>
<li>There may be problems if file names using upper case letters are used in submissions. The FDA technical conformance guide specifies the use of lower case letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be held at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday, December 8, 2023.</p>

<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo laid out a timeline for evaluating Pilot 3, saying it would take an additional six to seven months to complete.</li>
<li>Ben said that there is quite a bit of interest at GSK about the ADRG because Pilot 3 did not use pkglite.</li>
<li>HyeSoo remarked that the ADRG is different but that her preliminary look did not show any problems.</li>
<li>There was some discussion abut looking back at the ADRGs made for both Pilot 2 and Pilot 3.</li>
<li>Eric noted that he made the Pilot 2 ADRG in Quarto and was very happy with the workflow.</li>
<li>We can expect feedback on the review during our normal sessions.</li>
<li>Ben Staub noted that Novo Nordisk about presentation about their recent R submission.</li>
<li>Paul remarked that he cannot comment on the Novo Nordisk submission since it is not finalized, but he did say that what Novo Nordisk said in their presentation about keeping things simple (limiting packages and dependencies) and being able to trace key endpoints is the same advice the FDA would be give.</li>
<li>Paul also noted that the fact that the FDA is not able to comment on submissions in progress is one reason why it is nice to have a pilot.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric reported that he had the opportunity with meet with the Appsilon folks helping with Pilot 4 at posit::conf and that next sprint on the project will begin this coming week.</li>
<li>JBR brought up on several limitations to WebAssembly, such as not being able to accommodate networking functions in the browser.</li>
<li>Eric replied that Pilot 4 is not likely to hit the constraining limits, but that these may become a concern as we move into more robust submissions in 2024. (This discussion begins about 21:00 in the video)</li>
<li>JBR asks that we take the trouble to communicate clearly about our knowledge of the limitations.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about whether the FDA would be ready to receive a container based sub-submission.</li>
<li>The agreed that Pilot 4 in two parts: part a will be WebAssembly based and part b sill be based on containers.</li>
<li>Eric believes that he will be ready to submit Part 4.a in mid December. Paul will confer with his management about resources being available in that time frame.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about whether setting up a server with containers outside of the FDA would we be helpful for FDA reviewers becoming familiar with Podman.</li>
<li>JBR remarked that other working groups are interested in establishing protocols, best practices, and requirements for repositories.</li>
<li>Paul noted that from the FDA’s point of view, longevity should be a requirement noting that 6 years would be a minimum and there may be reasons to consider 20 years.</li>
<li>The group decided that it would be feasible and may be helpful to set up a server with the Pilot 2 submission shiny app running in a container.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provided a status up date on Pilot 4 describing the significant progress that has been made with developing prototypes for both the WebAssemply and Container approaches.</p>
<section id="webassembly" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webassembly">WebAssembly</h4>
<ul>
<li>At 19:48 minutes in to the video Eric displays the Pilot 4 teams minutes for their recent meeting, <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot4/minutes/2023-08-18/">Minutes 2023-08-18</a>, and talks through the activities.</li>
<li>George Stagg and Winston Chang from Posit attended the Pilot 4 meeting</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=httpuv">httpuv</a> R package will be necessary to start up a mini web server in the user’s local environment. There will be a script to accomplish this.</li>
<li>There will be no traces of the Shiny app interacting with the host system</li>
<li>Binaries of the packages used will be included in the transfer. These will not be executable binaries. They will be similar to .tar or .zip files.</li>
<li>The end user will have to install the version of R used in Pilot 1</li>
<li><a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html">Shinylive</a> is another rapidly developing technology that may per pertinent to Pilot 4. Currently Shinylive is only available for Python. However, Winston Chang expects the R based version will be available soon.</li>
<li>Eric demos Shinylive from the posit website at 28:00 minutes into the video</li>
<li>See the Posit post <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/08/webr-0-2-0/">webR 0.2.0</a> for additional information.</li>
<li>A Pilot 4 submission based on WebAssembly technology looks feasible by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="containers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="containers">Containers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eric’s team already has a Podman container with Pilot 2 running</li>
<li>The team is waiting for Paul to clarify what is required by the FDA IT team for them be able to receive containers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preferred-technology" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preferred-technology">Preferred technology</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the WebAssembly version does not require the involvement of FDA technology, it looks like it is the preferred method for a first Pilot 4 submission</li>
<li>At 37:43 minutes into the video, Eric shows the “Hello World” version of a WebAssembly submission created by Appsilon engineers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="promotion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="promotion">Promotion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Rickert suggests that the story of the Submissions group cooperative effort is as important as the story of the technology.</li>
<li>The story of the overall submission group should be written up, However, Joe proposed that since the Pilot 4 effort is moving so quickly and involves contributions not only from working group members, but also from vendors we should tell this story first while the details are fresh.</li>
<li>Eric agrees that the participation of the two development teams from Posit and Appsilon is unique.</li>
<li>Eric notes that he has submitted a talk about Pilot 4 for the R/Pharma conference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eric and Ning will update the GitHub sites for the Pilot teams to make sure the information is up to date and all the contributors are recognized.</li>
<li>Eric, Joe, Eric agree to work on an end of year thank you / celebration post.</li>
<li>Joe will make sure the R Consortium promotes Eric’s talk</li>

<section id="novo-nordisk-submission" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="novo-nordisk-submission">Novo Nordisk Submission</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joe asked the group if anyone has information about the Novo Nordisk all R submission.</li>
<li>See the upcoming <a href="https://posit.co/blog/novo-nordisks-journey-to-an-r-based-fda-submission/">webinar</a></li>

<p>The meeting was recorded and the <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/share/iap2ryh7-PHu8_fOMfwtXHpO7D7hB333mCsNODLlxE99EoCGXRTm1MSEFP7ceXzk.DnZSMt89C-TB8tZj?startTime=1691165275000">video</a> is available.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>HyeSoo Cho reported that she is working with the Pilot 2 re-submission and that it looks good.</li>
<li>HyeSoo expects that the final on this pilot submission will be available at the end of August.</li>
<li>Everyone recognized and thanked Eric Nantz for the sustained and last-minute efforts to get the submission out.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paul Schuette brought the attention of the group to section 4.i.2.10 of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/study-data-technical-conformance-guide-technical-specifications-document">Study Data Technical Conformance Guide - Technical Specification Document</a> and noted that .r and .zip files are listed as acceptable file formats for submissions.</li>
<li>After some discussion, the WG decided not to use <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkglite">pkglite</a> to wrap the R code as has been done in previous submissions, but to use .r files for the code. (Note that the FDA is unable to use .R internally.)</li>
<li>Paul noted that the FDA desires submission materials to be applicable for at least six years after submission. This triggered a discussion about possibility of using .zip files to transmit the proprietary packages, instead of pulling them from public GitHub repos as been done so far.</li>
<li>In the end, the WG decided to stick with using GitHub repos for Pilot 3 as there is currently no apparent advantage testing the .zip file method at this time.</li>
<li>Joel Laxama reported that preparations for Pilot 3 are going well, and that a submission using .r files could be made in early September.</li>
<li>The WG thought it best to wait for the report of Pilot 2 before submitting Pilot 3.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eric reported that thanks to the contributions form the <a href="https://appsilon.com/">Appsilon</a> team significant progress has been made on using both mechanisms for packaging R submissions: Containers and <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly</a>.</li>
<li>Appsilon has a prototype submission using <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> container technology working and has confirmed that it does not cause files to be written to the hard-drive.</li>
<li>Eric and the Appsilon engineers also have a very preliminary prototype of using Webassembly to wrap a small Shiny app working.</li>
<li>Posit engineers have contributed <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=webr">webr</a> expertise.</li>
<li>Eric is optimistic about having Pilot submissions based on at least one, and possibly both, of these technologies ready by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paul will confer with the proper FDA authorities to determine what preparations need to be undertaken by the FDA to use the Podman containers.</li>
<li>Eric will invite an Appsilon representative to come to a future meeting of this working group</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="july-21-san-jose-state-r-foundation-event">July 21 San Jose State R Foundation Event</h3>
<p>The R Foundation <a href="https://bbsw-tickets.ticketleap.com/summer-r-day2/">SummeR Bay Area R Meetup</a> was held at San Jose State University on July 21. Ning Leng reports that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 50 plus attendees indicated that quite a few Bay Area companies are moving towards using R in preclinical and genomics research.</li>
<li>Representatives from several small CROs attended the meeting.</li>
<li>R Consortium recognition was not good among this group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>

<p>The meeting was recorded and the <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/share/UWy0e4rQiG-Qa7LJL8NT6cLCrl0PgqZPr93VAVBZowYbCnqZ01C1hQDf1haXAdM_.n__f-SUm5BcNMzgm?startTime=1688745965000">video</a> is available.</p>
<section id="pilot-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz has made progress on addressing the issues identified with the Pilot 2 resubmission. Fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-friendly warnings when filters result in an empty data set</li>
<li>Consistent footer and header notes in the tables titles that match the Pilot 1 output</li>
</ul>
<p>The only outstanding issue that is still being worked on is the warning message that results from loading the <code>teal</code> package from GitHub because it is not yet on CRAN.</p>
<p>The Pilot 2 resubmission is now scheduled for 9AM PST on Wednesday July 19, 2023. Note that shortly after the meeting the date was confirmed with Beverly Chin and HyeSoo Cho.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong> JBR to schedule a zoom meeting and invite:</p>

<li>HyeSoo Cho</li>
<li>Beverly Chin</li>
<li>Ning Leng</li>
<li>Eric Nantz</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>Joel Laxamana provide the status update on Pilot 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot 3 team is developing the testing process and updating the ADRG to follow the process used in Pilots 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Developing the testing process is taking longer than expected because they are attempting to develop a hybrid of the different process used in Pilot 1 and Pilot 2.</li>
<li>The group is now targeting the first or second week of August for the Pilot 3 submission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joel will confer with Eric and Nan at a separate meeting.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric began the status update by thanking the team members from Appsilon who have set up a robust container environment for the Pilot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saghir has been able to get the container and app running in his environment</li>
<li>We must work with the FDA to determine the best method of transferring the container</li>
<li>Team members from Posit are working with the the WebAssembly</li>
<li>The major technical requirement is that the FDA reviewers will be able to run the <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> container environment</li>
<li>Right now, we believe that the WebAssembly, if it works as advertised, would be preferred by the FDA</li>
<li>It was noted that that FDA primarily works in a Windows environment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JBR to discuss FDA constraints and preferences with Paul Schuette.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the working group will be at 9AM PST on Friday, August 4, 2023</p>

<section id="pilot-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<p>JBR brought the meeting to order and Paul Schuette gave an account FDA analyst HyeSoo Cho’s findings so far with respect to the Pilot 2 submission. Identified problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning messages about packages being loaded from GitHub. (Packages should be loaded from CRAN or some other curated repository which archives packages.)</li>
<li>Footnotes and reference numbers that appeared in the previous Pilot 2 submission were missing from some tables.</li>
<li>Instead of remaining unchanged, some p-values were replaced with the text “non applicable” when filters were applied to the KM curve.</li>
<li>It is possible to create an empty data set with conflicting filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although all agreed that these were relatively minor problems, it was nevertheless agreed that we should ask Hye Soo to stop her review, while Eric Nantz fixes the problems. The end goal is to have Pilot 2 be as clean as possible to serve as a model for future work.</p>
<p>The new schedule is to arrange for a new Pilot 2 Submission by the end of June. We will arrange for a new submission date when Eric is ready.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hye Soo Cho of the FDA reported that her review of the Pilot 2 submission is going well and that she expects to be finished in June.</li>
<li>She is not sure how long it will take the FDA to produce a written response.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>Joel Laxamana reported on Pilot 3 work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The execution team isfocusing on documentation particularly in the ADRG.</li>
<li>The WG confirmed that Pilot 3 should follow the Pilot 2 approach and send the renv.lock file in the R package text.</li>
<li>There was a question about SDTM Versions. The WG confirmed that the Pilot 3 should use the same 1.4 STDM version as Pilots 1 and 2. See <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/104">Issue #104</a>.</li>
<li>QC Findings will go as Appendix to the ADRG.</li>
<li>The WG agreed that the second week in July would be a good target for Pilot 3 Submission.</li>
</ul>

<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric Nantz provided an update on Pilot 4 work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric expects to have the first meeting of the execution team volunteers in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Eric is taking a step back from committing to a container based approach in order to consider the possibility of using a self executing app in the browser using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>.</li>
<li>George Stagg from Posit is providing some assistance.</li>
<li>The idea is that the R submission code would run in a browser on the local machine of an FDA analyst.</li>
<li>Paul Schuette indicated that this approach would likely be possible at the FDA.</li>
<li>Eric said that he would be happy to try and replicate the FDA web browser environment.</li>
<li>The group suggested that a Webinar for the R Adoption series and other venues would be valuable for promoting the project.</li>
<li>Paul speculated that this web browser technology might also be useful to FDA field inspectors.</li>
<li>Eric noted that a selection core of R packages is being identified to have them run run “out of the box”.</li>
<li>If you would like to be part of the Pilot 4 team please contact Eric Nantz.</li>
<li>Paul noted that recent events where outside entities can re-litigate FDA approvals decades after the approval could make it even more necessary to be able to run analysis software many years after the submission.</li>
<li>JBR surmised that there may be interest in WG to explore long term archiving.</li>
</ul>

<section id="other-discussions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-discussions">Other discussions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nan Xiao brought attention to a <a href="https://www.jpma.or.jp/information/evaluation/results/allotment/DS_202204_oss.html">document</a> describing the submission WG in Japan. It refers to a survey about open source that mentions the Pilot 1 Submissions.</li>
<li>We are exploring the possibility of arranging for the authors of this document to participation in an R Adoption Series webinar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be on Friday, June 2, 2023 at 9AM Pacific Time.</p>

<section id="pilot-3-progress-update" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3-progress-update">Pilot 3 Progress Update</h2>
<p>Joel Laxamana provided the following update.</p>
<ul>
<li>All 5 ADaMs now generated and in review.</li>
<li>Per development steps, we have noted discrepancies or findings when comparing our Pilot 3 ADaMs with the original Pilot 1 ADaMs. You may see these noted in our Wiki here : https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/wiki/QC-Findings .</li>
<li>Minor updates are being made to clean up code, updating our variable labels appropriately and updating the ADaM specifications (define) to meet CDISC guidance as we go through our routine P21 checks.</li>
<li>We are also currently developing our ADRG based off of the Pilot 3 specifications we are reading into P21. We plan to use the P21 ADRG as a base, then we will add in information similar to that of Pilot 1 for complete instructions prior to submission.</li>
<li>As we finalize both the define and the ADaMs, we are also developing a batch run code to run all of our ADaM and TLF scripts, with that we are looking into implementing dependency recognition using a package called {targets} (e.g.&nbsp;before ADAE is run, checks latest ADSL code has been run first).<br>
</li>
<li>Additionally, we are rerunning all TFL scripts from Pilot 1 and re-sourcing the Pilot 3 data.</li>
<li>Once the above is finalized, we will do a batch run, check against P21, then bring everything over into our eSubmission repo. We have made contact with Roche’s Regulatory function who will help support the preparation of our eSubmission in eCTD structure.</li>
</ul>
<section id="current-project-workflow-discussion-as-seen-in-pilot-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-project-workflow-discussion-as-seen-in-pilot-1">Current Project workflow discussion as seen in Pilot 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Upon reviewing Pilot1’s work and the R4CSR guidance they have followed, we see the current flow suggests the use of 2 repos : 1)Project repo &amp; 2)Submission repo</li>
<li>In the project repo, this includes the project analysis R scripts (ADaMs and TFLs) and R utility functions within the same package.</li>
<li>14.2.2 programs</li>
<li>Folder path: ectddemo/m5/datasets/ectddemo/analysis/adam/programs/.</li>
<li>r0pkgs.txt: contains all internally developed proprietary R packages. Other .txt files: each contains R code for a specific analysis.</li>
<li>They also suggest using .RMD files as the source analysis scripts, which are then converted to .R/.txt for submission.</li>
<li>Then all .txt are brought over to the Submission repo to deliver to Regulatory for eCTD structure and formal submission to the FDA portal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Pilot 3 our project flow emulates more of the usual project work we would see in our companies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For instance, our source code will just use plain .R instead of .RMD as source analysis code. Especially for ADaMs, it make more sense to just start in .R scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>For the most part Pilot3 will follow the same submission process as Pilot1, but the minor difference will just be our project flow. I.E., Pilot 3 will separate the Utility functions from the Project analysis scripts into different repos. It makes more sense to treat the study specific utility functions as separate package, similar to how we call on other R packages from CRAN or other git repositories, where then the project analysis repo scripts will call on the aforementioned study specific utility functions package. This is still in line with the R4CSR guidance in section 14.3<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>Following this approach, makes it clear from a study perspective where the utility functions are being called from, where the project analysis scripts are stored and developed and where the submission will be. For illustration purposes we have this graphic (Thanks, Thomas Neitman!):</p>

</figure>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, to our Health Agencies, the single source of truth will of course come from our ‘Submission’ repo, where they may not need all of the details of the study project flow steps. We just wanted to be able to discern that R packages should be kept in their own packages and project analysis work should not be stored as a package.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Per Paul Schutter, Pilot 3 needs a link to the ‘FREE’ P21 version that the Pilot 3 team should be using. Paul to share link with Joel. We should also include SDTM in the P21 run, but just mention in the ADRG that we will not be updating or fixing the SDTMs due to any P21 issues to follow the same approach as Pilot 1. Though Pilot 3 is mainly focused on ADaMs, we do plan on fixing the P21 issues the best we can and noting discrepancies compared to the CDISCPILOT data.</li>
<li>Need new repo from submission_wg to store the utility functions into. Joe R, could you help us with this?</li>
<li>For the study project repo set-up, there are example template repos that can be followed. Pilot 3 team to look into this.</li>
<li>Targeting mid-June 2023 to wrap-up submission.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h2>
<p>Eric Nantz gave a brief update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric is starting to build a team and already has some volunteers</li>
<li>The effort will focus on container technology</li>
<li>Paul Schuette will reach out within the FDA to find an FDA participant for this group</li>
<li>Paul noted that anything having to do with servers would necessarily involve the use of contractors and have to have a budget.</li>
<li>There may be a way to have the container run on a laptop and thus avoid the complications caused by servers. *Ning Leng asked Paul if there are any other groups within the FDA that might be interested in pilots. Paul replied that the guidance he has received from management is to hold off on this for the time being.</li>

<section id="asa-webinar" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="asa-webinar">ASA Webinar</h2>
<p>JBR Informed the WG that the ASA New Jersey Chapter has contacted him about doing a webinar on the Submissions WG. The email below outlines a list of options.</p>
<ul>
<li>The WG was enthusiastic about doing a robust webinar with multiple talks sometime after the Pilot 2 submission in June.</li>
<li>Paul said that he would like to participate and asked if other ASA members could attend. Paul noted that he has had requests to speak from pharma companies, but it is difficult for FDA speakers to speak to individual companies without committing to speak to all companies.</li>
<li>The WG would like to co-brand the event as an <em>R Adoption Series Event</em></li>

<section id="march-26-2023-email-from-sciling-ruan" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="march-26-2023-email-from-sciling-ruan">March 26, 2023 email from Sciling Ruan</h4>
<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>It was very nice to speak to you last week and learned about what you do in the R-Submission working group. As discussed, we are very interested in collaborating with you to bring the topic of R-submission to our webinar. I also include our ASA NJ Chapter President Dirk Moore in the loop. Dirk is a faculty member in Rutgers University, and he will also help organize the webinar.</p>
<p>I understand that you will need to discuss this collaboration within your working group. I would like to give more information in case it might be helpful.</p>
<p>The webinar can have one presentation or multiple presentations with different perspectives. So I would be interested to know the tentative presentation titles and speakers.<br>
The webinar can be set in any date and month. We are very flexible. Normally, to accommodate both east coast and west coast audience, we often recommend the time slot of 11:00-12:00 or till 1:00 EDT on a Friday.<br>
We might invite another speaker from a pharma company on their experience with R-submission (if we could identify a good speaker). In that case, the webinar will be two hours with a panel discussion. Will this set up OK with you? Once I have some information to work with, we will follow up with a kickoff meeting including all potential speakers to work out the details. The webinar will use the WebEx platform in Rutgers University. It will be a free event to everyone.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you. If you need more information from me, please let me know.</p>
<p>Best regards, Shiling Ruan</p>

<section id="additional-conferences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-conferences">Additional Conferences</h3>
<p>In general, the WG is keen about promoting their work after the submission of Pilot 2 and the group discussed possible opportunities for talks alter this year including the R / Pharma conference and possibly and FDA event. The group will discuss this at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The next meeting of the WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Friday May 5, 2023.</p>

<p>The meeting was recorded and the <a href="https://positpbc.zoom.us/rec/share/q2j9oskw1QXsUzjeI9NfdvBFYZcy6ml1aqCqGYRmtUC_NeH7RYUKePzyfj-e1OIS.y_DcC-vgNR4sVWjw">video</a> is available.</p>
<p>Due to a problem with zoom permissions, the meeting started 15 minutes late. Apologize to everyone who was inconvenienced.</p>
<p>(At 1:37 into the video) HyeSoo Cho begins sharing here screen and providing her comments on the recent Pilot 2 submission.</p>
<p>A bug in the submission code caused population subsetting in the Kaplan Meier Curve to propagate silently throughout the <code>shiny</code> app. During the course of the meeting Eric Nantz was able to identify the problem as a incorrectly set option and correct it.</p>
<p>JBR noted that turning off subgrouping for everything but the KM plot was a special requirement for the pilot submission and asked if under normal operation whether the FDA reviewers would like the <code>shiny</code> app to display this default behavior. (The alternative would be for app users to remember to turn on the same subgrouping for every plot or table in order to make comparisons.) HeySoo and Paul Schuette provided an explanation of the FDA’s need to be very careful of subgroup analysis.</p>
<p>Paul emphasized that it is very important to distinguish between “exploratory analysis” and analysis for “inferential analysis”. Subgrouping that causes p-values to change cross the line between the two types of analyses. The FDA is very concerned that the misuse of subgrouping could lead people to improperly argue for evidence of efficacy based on restricted subpopulations. When asked if he was advising that submissions should not contain interactive capabilities Paul replied “No”. He elaborated that nothing interactive should produce a p-value.</p>
<p>(10:48 into the video) Ning Leng asked if subpopulation analyses associated with predefined endpoints would be permissible as this would distinguish between inferential and exploratory analyses. Paul replied this is correct. He noted that prespecified subgroup analyses will often product confidence intervals but not p-values.</p>
<p>(At 19:56) Eric announced the resolution to the parameter problem and the group agreed that we have a path forward for the current Pilot 2 submission. Eric also suggested that the interactivity may be the biggest topic for the group to discuss. Paul asked to defer the discussion of this bigger issue and suggested that the working group look to the <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.ZAKTTuzML0q">ASA statement on p-values</a> for guidance.</p>
<p>(18:36) The FDA does not want to be seen as endorsing the practice of rescuing a “failed” clinical trial by torturing the data. He noted that even now there is a problem with JMP and other tools that that are interactive but do not produce an open and fully transparent analysis true.</p>
<p>Interactive tool must be open, transparent, reproducible, and consistent with good statistical practices. Paul suggested that an interactive tool that produces interactive tools on demand may not be consistent with the ASA statement on p-values.</p>
<p>In response to a question, Paul affirmed that the ASA statement in p-values is a good foundation for understanding FDA practices.</p>
<p>(22:57) Begins a discussion on <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shinymeta"><code>shinymeta</code></a> and reproducibility. It as also noted that the <a href="https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code/main/articles/teal-code.html">teal</a> project is also addressing this reproducibility issue.</p>
<p>(27:43) HeySoo resumes her comments on the Pilot 2 submission by commenting on the warning and error messages generated by the submission code, and points out that referencing a repository other than CRAN is problematic. Paul noted that FDA IT security is insisting on strong security checks, but that a case can be made that CRAN provides sufficient checks. He said that his group at the FDA is floating the notion of “curated” packages.</p>
<p>HeySoo suggested that providing a README file that discusses all the potential error and warning messages and what needs to be done to run the app properly. Paul noted that some of this information should be included in the app to make it as stand alone as possible.</p>
<p>The working group agreed that the next step should be to produce an updated Pilot 2 submission package and resubmit it through the gateway. This will make it for the FDA to produce a written response. We will proceed with Pilot 2 take 2.</p>
<p>Eric will deploy will a new version on our internal host so that everyone can review it before the second submission.</p>
<p>When asked if the FDA security work Paul mentioned would lead to a guidance document, Paul replied that it may and noted that there is an internal FDA working group addressing the problem, and that currently Python appears to be a bigger security problem than R.</p>
<p>(44:26) Paul informed the group that the FDA is being approached by multiple groups, including PhUSE and Transcelerate, about using R and validation issues. The FDA would coordinate the activities of these groups to prevent duplication of effort and decide who is going to do what. He also suggested that we should broaden our base within the FDA and seek to get John Scott and CBER involved.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong> JBR will invite someone from the R Validation Working Group to attend our next meeting and meet with Paul to identify a representative from PhUSE to invite.</p>
<p>The next meeting of the Submissions Working Group will be on Friday, April 7, 2023 at 9AM PST.</p>

<li><p>The Submission WG members were in general agreement that Pilot 3 should conform to the standards set in Pilot 1 and Pilot 2 and use the package paradigm.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric briefly described the mission of this Pilot to make use of container technology, and noted that one goal is to make the use of containers easier for non experts.</p>
</section>
<section id="meeting-invitation-issue" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meeting-invitation-issue">Meeting invitation Issue</h3>
<p>The group noticed that not everyone is getting the submissions to the Submissions WG meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Luke will relaunch the Submissions WG meeting and make sure that the Pilot 3 folks are also invited to the general submissions WG meeting</p></li>
<li><p>JBR and Luke will work together to determine who should receive invitations.</p></li>
<li><p>JBR wants to make sure that although inactive members will be removed from the current invitation list, we will keep a record of their participation and maintain a list of current and past WG members somewhere on the website.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="new-submissions-wg-website" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-submissions-wg-website">New Submissions WG Website</h3>
<p>At 17:45 into the video Eric presents the new Quarto based website he has created for the WG. Eric has automated many of the task required to generate minutes and track members.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Joel will work with Eric to build out the Pilot 3 part of the site.</p></li>
<li><p>Eric will select a time to provide a tutorial on using the website for JBR and Luke and record the session to share with others.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="discussion-about-device-submissions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-about-device-submissions">Discussion about Device Submissions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>JBR mentioned that in a recent conversation asked if this group Robert Gentleman would be interested in R based device submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul noted that there is already a group making device submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>See the <a href="https://www.niss.org/news/niss-merck-meet-discusses-open-source-software-pharma-april-21-2021">video</a> of the recent NISS-Merk meetup for some details. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarek-haddad-07003a10/">Tarek Haddad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedlystig/">Ted Lystig</a> could provide more information.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-devices-and-radiological-health/cdrh-offices">CDRH</a> does not have these same CDISC structure that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder">CDER</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-biologics-evaluation-and-research-cber">CBER</a> have.</p></li>
<li><p>CDRH has different requirements and is more flexible than CDER and CBER. The restrictions imposed by the CDER gateway generally has to do with accommodating large data sets. In general, CDRH data sets are not so large.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paul offered to contact John Scott, Director of the CBER Biostats group, to see if his group has any interest in submissions.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="transcelerate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transcelerate">Transcelerate</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Paul noted that there was a recent FDA meeting with <a href="https://www.transceleratebiopharmainc.com/">Transcelerate</a> in which Transcelerate proposed projects to which Paul responded that some of the proposed work is already being done by the Submission Working Group.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul also noted the RC work is going well.</p></li>
<li><p>JBR asked if we should reach out to Transcelerate and Pau suggested Keaven Anderson of Merck</p></li>
<li><p>Paul offered to make introductions to the R Consortium if they are willing.</p></li>
<li><p>JBR noted that the RC is very willing to welcome Transcelerate into its efforts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The next meeting will be at 9:00 AM Pacific Time on Friday, March 3, 2023.</strong></p>

<li>They encountered a few messages that they ignored, as the app still ran successfully</li>
<li>HyeSoo Cho followed the ADRG instructions and launched Shiny app, without major issues</li>
<li>She noticed minor issues around errors and warning messages. As part of her evaluation she tried launching the app in different machines to compare results. She saw some inconsistency between the environments, and they will report specific findings by next month (February)</li>

<li>Running into minor issues with using the same specifications and define settings as the original Pilot 1</li>
<li>They are not clear on the most up-to-date specifications to use for the AdAM creation, would like help from others</li>
<li>Thomas found a Phuse 2017 white paper on transport files for the next generation. This paper proposed new ways to convert the data before transfer</li>
<li>Additional ideas such as a proposal to use JSON format <a href="https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/ODM2/Dataset-JSON" class="uri">https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/ODM2/Dataset-JSON</a></li>
<li>FDA is aware of the proposal, but it is not clear how far the proposal has gone</li>
<li>Study Data Technical Conformance Guide details the latest specs and what is acceptable in the gateway <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/162867/download" class="uri">https://www.fda.gov/media/162867/download</a></li>
<li>Sponsors can use SAS version 8 of XPT if they choose, most sponsors are using version 5 from their experience</li>
<li>Other pilots have explored alternative formats, but have not been satisfactory in their opinion</li>
<li>It is common to convert the XPT format to a more consumable format. For instance as sas7bdat in SAS or R objects inside R.</li>
<li>Pilot 3 will adhere to the current specifications</li>
<li>Ben recommended consulting with Sam Hume as a collaborate to push the effort along</li>
<li>The ectd gateway would need updating to accommodate json formats. That would require discussions with the E-data team in the FDA</li>

<section id="r-validation-hub-intro-to-repositories-working-group" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-validation-hub-intro-to-repositories-working-group">R Validation Hub intro to Repositories working group</h3>
<ul>
<li>Doug Kelkhoff and Kevin Kunzmann led a an introduction to the mission and goals of the working group</li>
<li>Mission is to support a transparent cross-industry approach of maintaining a repo of R packages with evidence of their quality and assessment criteria</li>
<li>Repo structure may resemble pieces of CRAN, R Universe . Still in the early stages of finding what is needed before working on the technical solutions</li>
<li>Asks for regulatory input: Work with the team to understand how you want to observe quality. Paul mentioned that bigger issues that FDA are thinking about are from the IT perspective (making sure that packages don’t compromise infrastructure). Example of haven running into buffer overflow issues. Typically those concerns are raised by security team colleagues. They are not aware of any independent effort to gauge the quality of an R package. Typically they point people to the R Validation Hub. While it is not doing independent replication of algorithms, it is a reasonable attempt in the right direction. Typically all pieces of software give you the “as-is” message and no implied guarantee of quality</li>
<li>Asks for industry input: Contribute by direct support, or by intermittent feedback as they prepare deliverables</li>
<li>High level of planned deliverables: List of quality criteria, mockup of the communication portal, and an example of a package server modelling a real-world workflow</li>
<li>Visit the repository to get involved <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg" class="uri">https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg</a></li>
<li>Ben asked about ways to consolidation various validation efforts heard from other sponsors. What existing tools are being implemented in this space?</li>
<li>Doug shared an article from the ASA Biopharmaceutical Report regarding the risk assessment of R packages: <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/blog/2022/12/05/2022-12-05-asa-biopharmaceutical-report-fall-2022/" class="uri">https://www.pharmar.org/blog/2022/12/05/2022-12-05-asa-biopharmaceutical-report-fall-2022/</a></li>

<section id="pilot-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-2">Pilot 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ning Leng and Eric Nantz reported that Pilot 2 was submitted on 2022-11-18, upholding the working groups tradition of submitting right before Thanksgiving, and that confirmation was received from the the FDA.</li>
<li>Paul Schuette explained that since Pilot 2 was not a production submission it was necessary to make a manual request to receive it. Consequently, his group did not receive it until earlier this wee.</li>
<li>Heysoo Cho said that she will begin working on the submission next week.</li>
<li>Eric Nantz offered to be available to help if the FDA had any questions.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pilot-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-3">Pilot 3</h3>
<p>Joel Laxamana briefly reviewed the preparations his team is making for Pilot 3 and said that the proposal is ready for transmission to the FDA. Paul suggested that the proposal should be sent to everyone in the working group and not just the FDA. Joel agreed to put the proposal in the Submissions WG GitHub repository and send the link to everyone in the working group.</p>
<p>Joel noted that many of the Pilot 3 concepts were taken from the ADRG for Pilot 2 and mentioned that they are checking against the CDISC versions as they build the package.</p>
</section>
<section id="pilot-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-4">Pilot 4</h3>
<p>Eric said that he hopes to ramp up Pilot 4 work after the Pilot 2 submission. The simplest plan will be just to containerize the Pilot 2 submission. <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> is the initial choice for a the container technology.</p>
<p>The group also expressed about aligning the Pilot 4 project with the Validation Hub to stand up a repo of validated packages. This would open up the possibility of hosting the container on the validation repo. The Validation Hub repo for this project is: https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg</p>
</section>
<section id="other-business" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-business">Other Business</h3>
<p>JBR asked Ning and Joel for summary paragraphs for Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 for inclusion in end of the year reports on working group status. Ning is working on a blog post about Pilot 2 for inclusion in the R Consortium Blog.</p>
<p>There were no updates available about efforts to make pilot submissions to other regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>The following events were identified as possibilities for delivering presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Appsilon Shiny conference: <a href="https://shinyconf.appsilon.com/">ShinyConf 2023</a> March 15-17 - Ning and Eric are drafting an abstract</li>
<li>R/Medicine June 8-9</li>
<li>R/Pharma</li>
<li>useR! 2023</li>
<li>Posit::conf</li>
<li>ASA BioPharma SWE Workshop in September</li>
</ul>
<section id="other-future-plans" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-future-plans">Other future plans:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ning noted that she and Yilong have been thinking about a journal submission and have begun writing a draft.</li>
<li>The group also agreed that they would like to do another R - Adoption Webinar.</li>
<li>Finally, Eric noted that he would like to rework the Submissions repository site and build it on a Quarto framework.</li>
<li><strong>The next meeting of the Submissions WG will be at 10AM PST, Friday 13, 2023.</strong> This is a one week delay to move the meeting beyond the holiday season.</li>
